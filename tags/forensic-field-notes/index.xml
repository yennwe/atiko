      <description>Death is often seen as obscure and horrific, and various perceptions have arisen around it, both scientific and superstitious. Forensic pathology, the oldest and most important branch of the forensic profession with its own aura of mystery, has been given more mystery because it focuses on the study of death and corpses.
I first learned about the profession of &amp;ldquo;forensic medicine&amp;rdquo;, in fact, through a film and television drama. At that time, I was still in junior high school, and every night at dinner time, the TV would play a domestic criminal investigation drama, the specific name of the drama now can not remember, only remember that there are a lot of such as &amp;ldquo;extract evidence back to the laboratory to check&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;decent scientific analysis&amp;rdquo; and such unexplained scenes, the main object of examination is the bones, fingerprints, blood, etc.</description>

      <description>We have all seen the crime, kill people and then do their best to conceal the facts of the crime, but who has heard of the race to become a murderer?
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to work tomorrow, it&amp;rsquo;s great, it&amp;rsquo;s great! I&amp;rsquo;m not going to work tomorrow, so I can be as lazy as I want! Listening to the rhythm of the music on my phone, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but hum along.</description>

      <description>But all the things in this world, there is a first time. Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.
My first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first.</description>

      <description>In the above scene, the deceased died by falling from a height, which is commonly known as &amp;ldquo;jumping&amp;rdquo;. Injuries caused by collision between the human body and the ground or certain objects during the fall are called fall injuries. The form and degree of injury are influenced by the height of the fall, the weight, the presence or absence of obstructions during the fall, the landing method, the landing area, the condition of the ground, and many other factors.</description>

      <description>Those with distinctive features and multiple eyewitnesses of the high fall is easier to determine the nature of death, defined as an accident or suicide is a relatively simple matter, after the investigation there is no obvious doubt also generally do not need to be dissected; witnesses are sufficient, the family of the deceased usually will not have any questions. If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.</description>

      <description>In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed. Originally this furniture city because of the remote location, closing time early every day, business has been difficult to do, today there is actually a corpse inexplicably appeared. Now it was completely out of business.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s really bad luck,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Jin whined to us while leading us to the entrance of his store, pointing to the ceiling and saying to us, &amp;ldquo;Look, I was the last one to leave at 6 pm last night, and everything was fine when it closed, and now it&amp;rsquo;s like this.</description>

      <description>Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over. But for those who are still alive behind them, this death is likely to be a lifetime of pain and suffering.
Being a forensic scientist is not just about facing corpses, it is also about facing the living. I said in the third &amp;ldquo;Salt Club&amp;rdquo; that</description>

      <title>7. How did the self-hanging lead to death?</title>

      <description>In the above case, the deceased died by hanging himself in this way. Death by hanging is caused by using all or part of one&amp;rsquo;s own weight to compress a rope or other similar object around the neck.
The majority of hangings are suicides, or self-hangings, commonly known as &amp;ldquo;hanging&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hanging&amp;rdquo;. As a &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; death that often appears in various TV dramas, I believe we are not unfamiliar with hanging, so how exactly does hanging lead to death?</description>

      <description>The actual work of the doctor, the face of the scene of self-hanging is too much. However, the majority of such scenes, by the time the forensic pathologist arrives, have been dead for some time, and the forensic pathologist is faced with a mere corpse.
I have the confidence that I can face any kind of corpse calmly, as to what the corpse actually experienced at the time of death, there are related text descriptions in the textbook, but those descriptions look cold and emotionless, I still have the confidence that I can be strong enough to face such description scenarios.</description>

      <description>After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging? This is not all wrapped around the neck with a rope to let people die?
Indeed, this kind of rope-like objects wrapped around the neck, through the application of external force, so that the rope-like objects compress the neck death is called strangulation, and hanged very similar.</description>
