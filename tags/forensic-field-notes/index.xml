      <description>Death is often seen as obscure and horrific, and various perceptions have arisen around it, both scientific and superstitious. Forensic pathology, the oldest and most important branch of the forensic profession with its own aura of mystery, has been given more mystery because it focuses on the study of death and corpses.
I first learned about the profession of &amp;ldquo;forensic medicine&amp;rdquo;, in fact, through a film and television drama. At that time, I was still in junior high school, and every night at dinner time, the TV would play a domestic criminal investigation drama, the specific name of the drama now can not remember, only remember that there are a lot of such as &amp;ldquo;extract evidence back to the laboratory to check&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;decent scientific analysis&amp;rdquo; and such unexplained scenes, the main object of examination is the bones, fingerprints, blood, etc.</description>

      <description>But all the things in this world, there is a first time. Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.
My first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first.</description>
