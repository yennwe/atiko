      <description>&amp;ldquo;Murder is sacred&amp;rdquo;: he is the only criminal with the word &amp;ldquo;ghost&amp;rdquo; in his criminal file! Killing is ritualistic!
&amp;ldquo;Why does everyone tell me that I can&amp;rsquo;t stay longer at the train station?&amp;rdquo; This is a question that many people have asked.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say an answer in my mind: because it is haunted and murderous!
This is also a real event that happened many years ago.
Putting aside the superstition, it is really haunted!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Murderer, Me!&amp;rdquo; : He was extremely twisted and played a provocative game with the police with his bizarre and sadistic methods of killing!
Do you know how scary it is to be friends with a man with a twisted mind?
He has a theory of his own, and whether it&amp;rsquo;s right or wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s irrefutable! If you look at you, he will change the way to be good to you, even he can not use the things to give you.</description>
