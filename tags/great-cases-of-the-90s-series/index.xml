      <description>July 1993.
I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how many times the police had a case analysis meeting.
During this month, various clues were collected one after another.
First, Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, gave the police a headache. Originally, the police ruled him out, after all, the second murder, he had an absolute alibi. As for why there was a human head and murder weapon in his house? Why did the murderer have to leave his name at the scene?</description>

      <description>I wiggled up frantically. This caught the attention of the killer, Zhang Jianjun.
He temporarily turned off the intercom and asked me again, &amp;ldquo;Where are you not feeling well? Do you want to sleep again.&amp;rdquo;
After saying that, he took out a pocket, took out a plastic bag, which was sealed with a white handkerchief.
Which I do not understand, immediately shook his head.
&amp;ldquo;Then what did you just wave?</description>
