      <description>Faced with all the discontents in his life, Gao Shi, at the age of 52, chose to resign and go to Chang&amp;rsquo;an to become a &amp;ldquo;Beijing drifter&amp;rdquo; again.
It took courage to make such a decision. In ancient China, it was not uncommon for people like Tao Yuanming to resign from their posts and return to their fields because they were unhappy with their jobs, but it was rare for people like Gao Shi to resign because he was dissatisfied with his job and rejoin the capital to find a job when he was over half a century old.</description>
