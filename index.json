[{"content":"The promotion path of people in the workplace is usually like this: employee \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; middle management \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; executive \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; VP level \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor.\nThe cognitive ability of investors is considered the top level, because investors need to have enough ability to predict the industry trends and know the future direction, so as to discover companies with potential (high probability of success) for investment.\nEach layer of cognitive ability is different, and the higher the level of cognitive ability, the stronger. Some people can jump up, while others are still stuck at a certain stage and find it difficult to move up. So what level are you at? Have you ever thought about how to change the status quo?\nHere are a few typical elements of cognitive upgrading (only a brief introduction, and not extended. In-depth thinking about these elements is covered in other articles in the cognitive series).\nCritique of self Upgrade from \u0026ldquo;I know I\u0026rsquo;m right\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;How do I know I\u0026rsquo;m right\u0026rdquo;.\nThese are two ways of thinking.\n\u0026ldquo;I know I\u0026rsquo;m right\u0026rdquo; is the subconscious response of most people, who decide that they are right at the subjective level of consciousness when making decisions, stemming from the ego\u0026rsquo;s unconditional trust in itself.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know I am right\u0026rdquo; is a typical expression of critical thinking. After the subjective consciousness makes a judgment, it does not rush to a conclusion first, but doubts the conclusion, must I be right, how did I determine that I am right. In the process of judging, what is the basis of my judgment, is my source of information accurate, and are there any omissions.\nThe former is \u0026lsquo;fast thinking\u0026rsquo; and the latter is \u0026lsquo;slow thinking\u0026rsquo;. Fast thinking is an ability evolved by humans in the evolutionary process to adapt to survival, manifested as seeing the wind blowing and grass to run, there may be a tiger hidden inside, in ancient times, those who did not run were eaten by wild animals. Others and their views do not agree, will subconsciously refute.\nOffended by someone, will immediately angry, into a state of battle. It\u0026rsquo;s like Homo sapiens in the tribal era, when Homo sapiens from another tribe entered your territory and posed a threat to you.\nThinking fast was very useful when humans did not have basic security issues addressed. But in modern society, human survival and security problems have also been basically solved, and there are no wild animals on the street or in the office. So this kind of fast thinking will be overwhelmed and unable to adapt in the face of complex problems.\nSlow thinking is more useful in the modern fast-paced information age, asking more questions about why, rather than making immediate decisions based on intuition. Intuition can be right or wrong. By thinking about things from a different perspective, you can come to more reliable conclusions. As I gradually allowed myself not to rely on my intuition, I found that many things were not as simple as they appeared and that I was able to control my emotions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t think of the solution as the problem itself. This phrase means that once you encounter a problem, don\u0026rsquo;t immediately look for a solution. Rather, first think, the problem is not the surface of the problem, whether there is a deeper problem. If a startup company is developing a new product and needs to hurry up and finish the development, but you find that your employees start to leave work on time and stop working hard, you may think that the problem is with the employees, if you think carefully about why the employees will leave work on time instead of trying to do a better job and create more value by working overtime in the company. It could be that the employee has something going on at home, or it could be that the employee doesn\u0026rsquo;t really understand why the company is rushing. Or it could be something else.\nThink outside the box Understand the limitations of human thinking caused by the evolution of the brain not keeping up with the technological explosion during the evolutionary process.\nNumerous facts show that the environment is changing so fast that natural selection (the evolution of the brain) has not kept pace.\nThe modern human brain evolved successfully 200,000 years ago.\nHowever, our brain capacity stopped growing 200,000 years ago. So, why didn\u0026rsquo;t the human brain get bigger? This may be because an increase in brain volume increases the risk of newborns at birth. In addition, our brain is a major energy consumer, consuming nearly 20% of our body\u0026rsquo;s energy, and if we increase its size, humans may not be able to meet the energy demands of the brain.\nThe science fiction novel \u0026ldquo;Three Bodies\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;technological explosion\u0026rdquo;. Humanity entered the industrial revolution three hundred years ago, the information revolution (the fourth industrial revolution) a few decades ago, and in recent years to the era of artificial intelligence, on the scale of 200,000 years, whether hundreds of years or decades, if calculated proportionally, not even a moment, so there is a technology explosion of this statement.\nAs mentioned earlier, \u0026ldquo;fast thinking\u0026rdquo; is an evolutionary limitation of thinking.\nCognitive scientists Messier and Sperber wrote: \u0026ldquo;Rationality is an adaptive trait that humans evolved to help individuals be able to adapt to life in highly social groups.\nHumans did not evolve rationality to solve abstract, logical problems or to help us draw conclusions from messy data, but to solve a range of problems encountered in group collaboration. If the early groups of humans to work together were a group of irrational people exist, then the fate of the group would eventually inevitably implode and disband. Imagine a scenario where everyone thinks he or she is the smartest one and is very emotional, thinking that everyone else is retarded, then when the group gets together to discuss things, it basically starts with a fight and ends with a group fight.\nIf rationality were to solve abstract problems, logical problems, then the human brain would not have so many cognitive biases (intuitions and biases), such as the \u0026ldquo;halo effect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;anchoring effect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;survivor bias\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nCritical thinking The ability to think independently and not follow the crowd.\nThe first thing is to question.\nWhether the other side has an interest in the viewpoint, and what kind of starting point and purpose they have in thinking that way.\nHow much truth there is in a news report, and what possible truths may be hidden behind it.\nIn what time and context did the author of the book come to such conclusions.\nIs the information we have one side of the story.\nDo I agree with the other side because the other side shares my views.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThe next step is to gather information.\nWhat information is available on the other side of the conflict of interest with the other side.\nWhat other people who have a different point of view than the author have to say\nWhat are the stakeholders, what are their relationships like, and how do they trade with each other.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThen synthesize the analysis.\nWhich party has the most to gain from the whole event.\nHow does this matter affect me.\nHow do I need to respond.\nThis completes a process of independent thinking.\nKnow what you want Know the gap between fact and desire and the path of how to achieve the desire (goal).\nWhat is your goal.\nIn five years, what do you want yourself to be?\nWill you be smarter?\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nPrinciples to keep in mind in achieving your goals.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t focus on excelling, but rather on growing and improving\nA sense of accomplishment is the first self-driving force\nBe clear about the principles of goal setting\nBe clear about the possible reasons for not achieving your goals\nKnow the difference between the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; way of thinking\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.\nThe \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; are actually the difference between concrete and abstract ways of thinking.\nSay you have to do something: work 2 hours at night.\nA concrete mindset would think like this (what): you have to work 2 hours at night to finish a 3000-word document.\nThe abstract mindset would think something like this (why): What I\u0026rsquo;m going to do tonight will improve my writing.\nThe abstract way of thinking is the cause of the behavior, and the concrete way of thinking is the manifestation of the behavior. In contrast, the abstract way of thinking is more capable of giving motivation.\nMastering Methodology Have a methodology that works for you to make decisions.\nWhat is methodology. Methodology is the theory about the way people understand the world and transform the world. While worldview mainly solves the problem of \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; the world is, methodology mainly solves the problem of \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo;. Methodology is a theoretical system or system aimed at solving problems, usually involving the discussion of problem stages, tasks, tools, and methodological techniques.\nA brief introduction to a methodology.\nWSR methodology - proposed in 1994 at HULL University in the UK by Chinese systems science experts Prof. Kifa Gu and Dr. Zhichang Zhu - is very foreign and consists of the initials of three words: physical (W), matter (S), and human (R). In simple terms, it means: what, how, and who.\n\u0026ldquo;Physics\u0026rdquo; refers to the mechanism involving the movement of matter, which includes both physics in a narrow sense, but also chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy and so on. It is usually necessary to use natural science knowledge to answer mainly what \u0026ldquo;matter\u0026rdquo; is, such as the law of gravity describing free fall, the genetic code carried by the double helix in DNA, and the principle of nuclear power plants to convert the huge energy produced by nuclear reactions into electricity. Physics requires realism, the study of objective reality. The knowledge imparted by university science and engineering schools is mainly used to solve various \u0026ldquo;physical\u0026rdquo; problems.\n\u0026ldquo;Theory\u0026rdquo; refers to the rationale for doing things, mainly addressing how to arrange all the equipment, materials, and personnel. Knowledge of operations research and management science is often used to answer the question of \u0026ldquo;how to do it\u0026rdquo;. Typical examples are the Apollo program, the construction of nuclear power plants, and the design and management of supply chains.\n\u0026ldquo;Humanism\u0026rdquo; refers to the rationale of being a human being, which usually requires knowledge of humanities and social sciences to answer the questions of \u0026ldquo;what should be done\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;how best to do it\u0026rdquo;. In real life, no matter what \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; are done without human beings, and it is also up to human beings to judge whether these things and things are properly applied, so system practice must fully consider the human factor.\nPictures We can learn from these methodologies rather than accepting them wholesale. The more generic a methodology is, the more abstract it indicates, and the more difficult it is to practice it. So it\u0026rsquo;s important to learn from them and make trade-offs with your personal situation. To translate the WSR methodology, we can understand \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;tools\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;human nature\u0026rdquo;.\nWith a slight transformation, a formula is derived.\nMethodology = knowledge base + thinking tools + benefit distribution.\nIf you want to cook for a few friends at home (to solve a problem), then you first need to go shopping for food (knowledge base), if a dish is not made before, then maybe you need to go online to find recipes to see how to cook (thinking tools), and discuss the division of labor among friends (benefit distribution) - who washes, cuts, stirs, and washing dishes.\nHave the ability to discover the nature of things Understanding the cause and effect relationships behind the laws of real things and dealing with reality.\nThere are scientists on the blue planet; Newton discovered gravity, Einstein published the theory of relativity, and Darwin published the doctrine of evolutionary natural selection. These are all great things that happened in the field of science. Scientists have been exploring the nature of their field of expertise.\nThere are 13 constants in our universe, so to speak, and the properties and behavior of our universe can be deduced from these numbers, and changing the value of any one of them would not constitute our present universe. These 13 constants include: the universal gravitational constant, the speed of light, absolute zero, Hubble\u0026rsquo;s constant, Planck\u0026rsquo;s constant, etc. The cosmological numbers are those constants that are related to the physical laws of the universe. Not all numbers related to the natural world are cosmic numbers. The number 10, which is the basis of the modern decimal system, is a human invention, chosen because it is the number of fingers of our hands.\nEven a well-known cosmic physicist has suggested that the nature of the fourth universe is a mathematical structure. We are not going to explore here whether these theories about the nature of the universe are plausible or not, but we are talking about an issue that is very relevant to us.\nOrdinary people do not have the ability or the need to explore scientific truth, but there are still many questions in the world that we should think about, such as the nature of business, the nature of industry, the nature of something.\nFor example.\nThe nature of business model: the transaction structure of stakeholders\nThe essence of photography: the photographer uses the lens to capture an emotional moment and deliver it to the audience\nThe essence of Internet products: to help users save time or to help them pass the time\nThe essence of fiction: build a virtual world with words to tell a story and immerse the reader in it\nThe essence of finance: transfer of value across time.\nThe essence of the Chinese people\u0026rsquo;s liberation cause: class struggle\nThe essence of Tencent: connecting everything\nThe essence of Ali: online commercial real estate\nThe essence of search engines: Passive advertising\nThe essence of today\u0026rsquo;s headlines: trainable active advertising\nThe essence of social e-commerce: the trust of consuming social relationships\nThinking about the essence of a thing allows us to quickly grasp the point, and also to see through the various disguises above the essence at a glance.\nSeeing the world from an evolutionary perspective Whether anything and behavior is valuable, the scale of value is relative to survival.\nThe main components of Darwin\u0026rsquo;s evolutionary doctrine of natural selection are: overpopulation, struggle for survival (also called competition for survival), heredity and variation, and survival of the fittest.\nDarwin\u0026rsquo;s doctrine of evolutionary natural selection emphasizes not evolution, but adaptation. Only organisms that adapt to changes in their surroundings will survive.\nIf you choose a goal, then everything should be judged around that goal to see if it is worthwhile.\nOur anxiety comes from not knowing where to start, there are many things to do and each one is important. But we all forget what our original purpose was. We have a direction, but in the process, we throw it aside. It\u0026rsquo;s as if direction and goals are left behind the moment we set them down.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say our goal is to move from senior manager to director in three years. But there are many things in life and in the process that we would like to do.\nLearn the methodology of Raising Cognitive Ability and practice it\nRead regularly to ensure the knowledge base\nMany courses on knowledge payment, \u0026ldquo;Economics Course at Peking University\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Wu Jun Methodology\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Classical Music from Amateur to Appreciation\u0026rdquo; all feel quite good and want to learn but have limited time.\nRecently released some blockbuster movies, I also want to go to see them, otherwise I will be out of touch with the people around me.\nMy friend quit her job and is going on a trip to Turkey and Paris, and I want to see the world too.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nEverything looks valuable, and because of that, we become hard to choose and thus become anxious because we don\u0026rsquo;t have a standard to judge the value of a thing. This criterion is our goal, our desire.\nGoing back to the goal, since you want a promotion in your position, you should choose the first two. If your goal is to travel the world and entertain yourself, then choose the last two.\nIn business, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they are profitable for the business.\nIn life, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they contribute to the accomplishment of our personal goals.\nAchieve cognitive iteration Knowledge base and continuous learning.\nWe all know that the performance of a computer is determined by hardware (CPU, motherboard, memory, etc.) and operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and application software. If the hardware and operating system are consistent, the performance of the computer is determined by the application software.\nThe software and apps that run on the operating system, we call them programs. According to computer scientist von Neumann, program = data + algorithm. In fact operating system is also a specific program.\nIf we compare a person to a computer, then the human brain is the equivalent of the computer\u0026rsquo;s hardware, and the cognitive ability is the equivalent of the computer\u0026rsquo;s program. Cognitive ability (program) = learning method + knowledge base (data) + thinking style (algorithm).\nWhether it is continuous learning or lifelong learning, the purpose is the same effect as keeping the operating system and program updated and upgraded, so that the processing power of the human brain can be continuously improved.\nPictures Summary Generally speaking, people may have only certain elements, and in some elements a certain level. These elements interact with each other, and the process of cognitive upgrading is the upgrading of the proficiency level of mastery and use of the elements.\nThere is not a clear standard to state what tier has what criteria, it is recommended to start with a certain element to think deeply, practice and master.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/8geyaodianzhunishixianrenzhidiedai/","summary":"The promotion path of people in the workplace is usually like this: employee \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; middle management \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; executive \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; VP level \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor.\nThe cognitive ability of investors is considered the top level, because investors need to have enough ability to predict the industry trends and know the future direction, so as to discover companies with potential (high probability of success) for investment.","title":"3.8 points to help you achieve cognitive iteration"},{"content":"Before starting this book, let me start with a real experience of a user who consulted me, which I have annotated in red\nFemale, 22 years old, super sensitive Comment 1: A 22 year old girl, why is her skin super sensitive?

At that time, I was still in junior high school, and every night at dinner time, the TV would play a domestic criminal investigation drama, the specific name of the drama now can not remember, only remember that there are a lot of such as \u0026ldquo;extract evidence back to the laboratory to check\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;decent scientific analysis\u0026rdquo; and such unexplained scenes, the main object of examination is the bones, fingerprints, blood, etc., at that time, I felt that this work is really high-end. At that time, the Internet was not yet convenient, and without knowing more about the situation, I set myself the ideal of \u0026ldquo;to be such a forensic scientist\u0026rdquo;. Now I look back and think, this is not forensics! It was a hodgepodge of various branches of forensic science and trace inspection work, and in some places it was seriously out of touch with reality.\nWhen the college entrance examination, originally because of their own interest in mathematics, physics is pathetic, for biology, medical aspects is very much like, think to study medicine it. However, I was already very uncomfortable with the bad doctor-patient relationship, and I was tired of thinking about it. Although I remembered my dream of forensic medicine, I also thought that \u0026ldquo;forensic medicine is just contacting dead people\u0026rdquo;, and finally entered the pure engineering major of electrical information through various misunderstandings.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the first week of college, and the high math and physics could kill me a hundred times. I remembered my \u0026ldquo;forensic dream\u0026rdquo; again. Through communication with teachers and seniors, interviews, and attending professional courses, I firmly decided that I must study forensics. Luckily, the school had a policy of transferring majors, and I successfully transferred to the forensic science program.\nAfter so many years of personal experience in forensic science, I realized that there are so many things that people do not understand about this profession when they often ask me with hesitation or confusion. Out of my love for forensics, I started to popularize forensics on the Internet, hoping that more people would understand the real forensics, so that some unscientific and incorrect perceptions could be deciphered and this mysterious profession could be presented more realistically in front of everyone.

Write in front"},{"content":"But all the things in this world, there is a first time. Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.\nMy first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first. So, I came to a public security bureau as a small follower, and began the work of \u0026ldquo;trainee forensics\u0026rdquo;.\nThe first day, the director threw me a \u0026ldquo;forensic pathology\u0026rdquo; for me to read, because only freshman year, from the study of these specialized courses is still early, in fact, is also to read a plausible understanding of the. At night, in order not to miss the rare opportunity to learn, I chose to stay in the unit and asked the seniors on duty that day to call me if something came up. However, for several days in a row, it was \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo;, and the feeling of not being able to sleep with something in mind was really unpleasant.\nOne day, I finally waited for the first scene of my life, but in the excitement, I did not expect the first scene was quite heavy.\nThat morning at 5 o\u0026rsquo;clock, I was sleeping in the dark, the pillow phone suddenly rang. I got up from bed with a jolt and grabbed the phone to find that it was the director on duty that day, telling me to gather downstairs and have a scene.\nI quickly got up and dressed, too slow to wait for the elevator, directly from the stairs to the downstairs. But I was the only one downstairs with the chirping crickets, and I waited a few minutes before I saw the director come out with two people yawning. They expressed great appreciation for my positive, while separately recalling the passion of the year when they first joined the workforce - \u0026ldquo;young people are just energetic ah\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;really old hello\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThe scene of the incident was located in the urban-rural area, in front of a street store on the sidewalk of a road. When we arrived at the scene, there were a lot of onlookers gathered around, the first police station to arrive at the alarm has pulled a cordon, while trying to get the onlookers to disperse, but it did not help.\n\u0026ldquo;The first thing to do is to go to the trunk and carry a survey box out. The director explained to me, and then got out of the car to understand the situation.\nI picked up a large box with \u0026ldquo;forensic scene investigation\u0026rdquo; printed on it, bent over the police line and went inside. Thinking about this kind of thing in the past, I can only be a spectator outside, but this time I was able to walk in as a staff member with a cool case in hand, I could feel the eyes of many onlookers around me and the case in my hand, this feeling of being noticed is really great!\nApproaching the scene, first see is a propped open on the ground red umbrella, umbrella below is a bed quilt, can vaguely see a person under the quilt, around the ground scattered with some red and white things, there is a woolen hat covered in the ground. A middle-aged woman who claimed to be the daughter of the deceased said while crying: \u0026ldquo;In the morning \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I just got up \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; heard downstairs \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;someone downstairs shouting \u0026lsquo;dead people\u0026rsquo;, I lay down the window to look at \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; saw a person wearing my mother\u0026rsquo;s clothes lying on the ground \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I came down to see that it was my mother\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;Mom ah \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; why do you want to jump to your death ah!\nWhile the colleagues of the site survey are taking photos to fix the scene, I opened the survey box, took out gloves and handed a pair to the director, he also wore a good pair. When the photos were taken, the director walked up and lifted the woolen hat on the ground first, under the hat is also a puddle of red and white things, a bit like red oil bean flowers look like, the crowd saw this scene issued a gasp.\n\u0026ldquo;This is brain tissue.\u0026rdquo; The director said to me while squatting next to the corpse, \u0026ldquo;Be prepared for a while.\nThe director was just about to move away from the umbrella when the daughter of the deceased rushed over to stop us: \u0026ldquo;The deceased cannot show their faces to the sun! I muttered in my heart \u0026ldquo;What kind of feudal superstitious ideas are these? I looked at the director at the same time.\nThe director stood up and said to the daughter of the deceased, \u0026ldquo;We understand your feelings, but now we have to check the situation to determine how your mother died, what if someone killed your mother? The director went back and forth many times, but the daughter of the deceased just kept repeating \u0026ldquo;A deceased person cannot show his face to the sun!\nDirector to see the communication is not very smooth, called the police first to the daughter of the deceased to the side to record the situation, and then turned to me and said: \u0026ldquo;You play umbrella to her cover, the quilt first lift a little, I first look at the situation. I squatted down, holding an umbrella in one hand, and lifted a corner of the quilt on the ground with the other.\nUnderneath the quilt was a distorted blood-stained face, and on closer inspection, the blood was interspersed with white brain tissue. The director touched the corpse\u0026rsquo;s head and whispered to me: \u0026ldquo;Look at this head has been deformed, I feel there are many more fractures, the left side of this large piece of scalp cracked such a large mouth \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he said as he poked his fingers in. \u0026ldquo;Well \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; deep into the skull, the brain tissue is coming out of here.\u0026rdquo; The director then began to examine the ribs and limbs, the deceased\u0026rsquo;s right elbow twisted into a strange shape under the director\u0026rsquo;s hand, it seems there must be a fracture. The director covered the quilt after the inspection, asked me to put the umbrella back in place, called on me and the daughter of the deceased \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s go up and take a look\u0026rdquo;, and said to go to the door of the unit behind the building.\nThis is a small four-story building, we walked to the fourth floor when we saw a small door above, walked up to find a rooftop, the rooftop has a few color plates built temporary board room, the other side of a vacant lot pulled a few wire, above drying a few pieces of clothing. The daughter of the deceased came over to us and pointed out: \u0026ldquo;My mother lives in that room over there. I saw that the trace survey colleagues are taking pictures and checking the ground, went over and took a look at the probe: the room is a little too much stuff, but it\u0026rsquo;s still neat and tidy, feeling nothing obvious.\n\u0026ldquo;Come and take pictures!\u0026rdquo; I heard the director\u0026rsquo;s voice and looked back to find that the director had gone to the rooftop fence, there was a small bench overturned by the wall, the director poked out half of his body to look down and was calling for people to come over and take pictures. I also went over the probe to look outside and found that this position is exactly to the dead below, but did not find any other special problems. The director reached out to stop me when I wanted to probe a little farther.\n\u0026ldquo;Be careful not to rub! Look what\u0026rsquo;s here!\u0026rdquo; The director pointed to a spot on the fence that I had just immediately brushed against.\n\u0026ldquo;Are these \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; footprints?\u0026rdquo; I followed the director\u0026rsquo;s hand to look at the fence, but found a vague and not very obvious traces, change the angle of observation, and found that it looks like the sole of the forefoot pattern like traces.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a footprint. Now tell me what you think.\u0026rdquo; The director looked at me and said.\nI thought about it: \u0026ldquo;The deceased should have jumped from here!\nThe director nodded: \u0026ldquo;Well, a small part of it is right. But there is a detail you did not notice, you look outside again on the eaves what?\nOnce again, I looked out and saw that outside the rooftop was a small eave made of glazed tiles, only sticking out about 10 cm, and a small piece of dust had been rubbed off the eave, revealing the clean tiles underneath.\n\u0026ldquo;If the man jumped, why would the dust on the eaves be rubbed off?\nSeeing my face confused, the director went on to say: \u0026ldquo;You are just now in contact with these, it is normal to think not understand. The deceased is a very old lady, just now when I checked I found that her body muscle atrophy is very serious, which indicates that she died before a long period of bed rest, the body should be quite weak. She can climb this fence is already very difficult, where there is strength to \u0026lsquo;jump\u0026rsquo; down? And you see where she was lying on the ground is not much farther from the eaves of the house, so she should have climbed the fence and then slid down head first, against the eaves.\n\u0026ldquo;Director, then how did you determine that she slipped headfirst and was not picked up and thrown? I asked a question.\nThe director praised: \u0026ldquo;Very good! You are thinking very carefully. You look around the ground is very rough concrete, this ground is difficult to leave obvious footprints, and this is next to the drying clothes, there are footprints in addition to the dead is not surprising. But this small bench and the edge of the platform are only a footprint, looks very similar pattern, so I presume that the deceased stepped on the small bench that fell over, climbing the fence themselves. As for why the head down, you say it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well! I just read in the book you gave me yesterday that \u0026rsquo;there is a close relationship between the part of the ground and the injury received\u0026rsquo;. I spoke carefully while watching the director\u0026rsquo;s face, and found that he was slowly nodding his head, so I gained some more confidence. I continued: \u0026ldquo;We just saw the injuries to the head and limbs of the deceased below were obvious, so you presumed that it should be a head-down fall.\n\u0026ldquo;Very good! We need to combine all kinds of phenomena and detailed information in our forensic practice, which requires a lot of practice to accumulate experience, and we should often do this kind of thinking by heart. The director showed a little smile, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go, we did not find anything unusual, it should be the old lady\u0026rsquo;s own suicide. Let\u0026rsquo;s go ask the family again to see what they say.\u0026rdquo;\nWe found the daughter of the deceased again, we explained to her what we thought, and the daughter also said her guesses. It turns out that the old lady has not been in good health, more than half a year ago was diagnosed with cancer, in order to cure the disease sold the house but nothing, after spending all the savings is even no place to live, desperate under the only way to relatives, relatives can not live, on the roof of the building built a temporary house to live. After this, the old lady\u0026rsquo;s health is worse every day.\nThe daughter of the deceased looked at the place where her mother had lived and finally said, \u0026ldquo;My mother didn\u0026rsquo;t want to keep dragging us down, right?\nThis was my first time on the scene, my first time seeing a real death.\nAlthough freshman year in school just after learning anatomy, have seen the corpse, but also hands-on autopsy contact, but after all, it is a formalin-treated corpse, although the first time I saw the heart still shocked, but a semester down to get used to it, it is only as ordinary as the daily see the teacher. But this time I actually saw the death around me, and I personally felt the grief of the family.\nOn the way back, the chief saw me sitting in the car and said, \u0026ldquo;This is the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve seen such a scene, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? The police is a grounded job and can see the dark side of society. We are the police when the forensic is to see the people and things related to life and death, the death of a person ah, a lot of human feelings and warmth will come out. If you also come to public security as a forensic scientist, you will encounter more dark, negative things, you have to learn to keep yourself a clear heart ah.\nI am now working, although not a police officer, but also a forensic scientist. I have always taken to heart what the director said back then, and have been trying to practice it.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/2.fayishengyadediyicixianchang/","summary":"But all the things in this world, there is a first time. Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.\nMy first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first.","title":"2. Forensic career of the 'first' scene"},{"content":"In the above scene, the deceased died by falling from a height, which is commonly known as \u0026ldquo;jumping\u0026rdquo;. Injuries caused by collision between the human body and the ground or certain objects during the fall are called fall injuries. The form and degree of injury are influenced by the height of the fall, the weight, the presence or absence of obstructions during the fall, the landing method, the landing area, the condition of the ground, and many other factors.\nAccording to the physical knowledge, the greater the weight, the higher the height, the human body after the fall by the impact force is also greater, the more serious the damage suffered. Therefore, often fall from the same height of the child will be lighter than the adult injury is very much, there have been from more than ten floors because of the accidental fall of the child, fell on the car cushioned and then survive the news.\nThe most common parts of a fall are the head, heel and buttocks. When the head first hits the ground, the scalp can be cracked, skull and cervical vertebrae can be fractured, brain tissue can also be injured, the most serious is the occurrence of skull burst, brain tissue is severely damaged and rapid death, as in the case above; and if the lower limbs land vertically, in addition to fractures, trauma, landing vibration to the body, the rupture of internal organs and extensive fractures can occur; when the back, buttocks and other flat landing When the back, buttocks and other plane landing, if the height is not high, because the contact area is wide, the injury is often lighter than other parts of the same conditions of landing, but often fractures of the spine.\nTo summarize the injury of high fall, there are several characteristics.\nThe injury is heavy inside and light outside. Many high falls, the body surface seems to be no serious injury, in fact, may have occurred in multiple fractures, internal organs may also have ruptured causing internal bleeding.\nMultiple injuries are formed by a one-time violence. Injuries on the body can be explained by a single external force. If there is a need for multiple actions to form, it is often necessary to consider the possibility that there was already an injury before the fall.\nThe distribution of injuries is characteristic. Because the fall injury is basically an instant, so the injury is often concentrated on one side of the body or a certain direction, mostly direct landing position.\nDamage for the general manpower is difficult to form. The impact of a high fall is generally large, so the whole body caused by multiple fractures, and even limb transection, this injury is generally only rely on human power, or the use of tools to combat are difficult or impossible to form.\nOnce in a construction site on a very typical high fall.\nThe site is digging the foundation, the whole site is a deep pit. A worker was carrying cables on the ground, and he did not notice the clutter of cables under his feet. When the machine pulling the cables started, he tripped over the cables under his feet and fell from a height of about 30 meters to the foundation pit, which was almost 10 stories high.\nWhen we arrived at the scene, we saw the deceased lying on his back on the large and small debris at the bottom of the foundation pit. The worker who witnessed the whole process said that he fell face down at that time, and only when the 120 first aid people came to check him over.\nA brief examination of the body at the scene: the bones of both arms have been broken into several pieces, the right wrist has broken bones pierced the skin, like a spear, the right leg twisted to a peculiar shape pressed under the body; although the entire cranium felt nothing obviously broken, dislocation, but from his nostrils, ears, mouth have flowed a large amount of blood, a closer look at the blood flowing out of the ears and This is usually a sign of a skull base fracture; the \u0026ldquo;fluctuating sensation\u0026rdquo; of feeling the stomach like a balloon that is filled with water means that there is a lot of fluid in the stomach, which is often the result of a large blood vessel or organ rupture in the abdominal cavity causing hemorrhage.\nIn the above manifestations, whether it is a fracture of the arm, a fracture of the right leg, a fracture of the base of the skull, or a hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity, this can be explained by a one-time formation from a fall of about 10 floors, and there is no other apparently lethal injury on the body surface except for bleeding from the wrist and mouth, nose, and ear. The fracture at the base of the skull, the damage to the brain tissue, and the massive bleeding in the abdominal cavity are serious enough to constitute a fatal injury. Therefore, this is a very typical high fall in comparison to the above characteristics of high falls.\nHowever, these characteristics are only theoretical high fall characteristics, in practice, due to a variety of factors and completely different situation, the actual work should be based on the specific situation to specific analysis.\nThe theory is dead, and the application of the theory is alive.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/3.gaozhuizhihouhuifashengshenme/","summary":"In the above scene, the deceased died by falling from a height, which is commonly known as \u0026ldquo;jumping\u0026rdquo;.

What happens after a high fall"},{"content":"Those with distinctive features and multiple eyewitnesses of the high fall is easier to determine the nature of death, defined as an accident or suicide is a relatively simple matter, after the investigation there is no obvious doubt also generally do not need to be dissected; witnesses are sufficient, the family of the deceased usually will not have any questions. If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.\nIn my last semester of college, I had to go to the Public Security Bureau for a six-month internship. At this time, I had already learned my professional knowledge and needed to combine it with practice to better understand and master the application of this theoretical knowledge.\nAt 8:00 a.m., I was eating breakfast in the cafeteria, and as soon as I sat down, forensic scientist Sun, who was on duty that day, received a call: \u0026ldquo;A body was found in the river under a bridge, according to the public. I quickly pick up the bowl of rice, put on the \u0026ldquo;scene investigation\u0026rdquo; vest, get in the police car whistled to the scene.\nThe scene is under a highway bridge. This bridge on both sides of the non-motorized road and the middle of the motorway are parallel to the three bridges, the river under the bridge is not much, the flow is not very fast, the body is prone position soaked in the river, the motorway bridge is blocked by the second pier.\n\u0026ldquo;Notify the fire department to salvage the body? Sun forensics looked at the situation under the bridge after asking a small civilian police officer on the scene.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ll be here soon! Dr. Sun, you\u0026rsquo;re on duty again today, you see every time we go to work together, it\u0026rsquo;s always bad! This must not be a case!\u0026rdquo; (Many police officers call it a \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo; only if it involves a crime, but not if it can be ruled out.) The young police officer obviously knew Dr. Sun and came up to greet him, \u0026ldquo;Who is this?\n\u0026ldquo;This is the new intern student who came in a few days ago. Sun forensic doctor saw the police pointed at me, replied, \u0026ldquo;students who come to practice are looking forward to having a scene to move hands, we are the opposite, right?\n\u0026ldquo;That is of course, we work, certainly do not want to catch things when they are on duty, who wants to die? But this can not be helped, who made us do this business! The small police handed a cigarette to Sun forensics, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquo;Young people follow Sun forensics learn well, he is the best forensics here.\nAs we speak, the fire department has come, several young soldiers put on waterproof equipment, took the body bags we handed over and began to go down the river to retrieve the body.\nWatching the fire fighters tripped the river to the body next to the body in the body, Sun forensic shouted to them: \u0026ldquo;Do not rub the bottom of the river, do not touch the rocks! This is to prevent additional artificial damage on the corpse, bringing unnecessary trouble to the later autopsy.\nForensic scientist Sun led me to separate the weeds on the shore, a large circle to the river, the fire fighters have pulled the body to the shore. Sun forensics commanded the fire fighters to put the body flat on a slightly flatter riverbed, turned his head to look around as if looking for something, looked for a while to me to extend a hand. I understood the head down from the body of a vest pocket pulled out the mask, and from another pocket pulled out the gloves, rummaging and took out a ruler.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, you are really prepared ah, is simply a mobile survey box, the survey box and heavy, commonly used on those few things but to carry, some places that is really hard ah, the future do not need to bring a box, bring you a enough. Dr. Sun watched with interest as I took out one thing after another from my body like a magic trick.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s not make fun of me, let\u0026rsquo;s see the body first. This full of pockets of the \u0026ldquo;scene investigation\u0026rdquo; vest in the pockets of all kinds of commonly used supplies, this is still the habit of the previous apprenticeship, otherwise sometimes to some inconvenient place to work with the box is very affected.\nI also put on a pair of gloves, squatting down and began to find the zipper of the body bag. I did not expect to pull open the body bag, a huge wound on the top of the head appeared directly in front of our eyes, it looks like something hit out. Seeing this wound, Dr. Sun put away his smile just now, and his demeanor became serious.\nSun stopped me from reaching out to check the wound, and instead asked me to look through my pockets first, looking for ID cards, driver\u0026rsquo;s licenses and other things that can prove identity. I found a cell phone in the pocket of the leather jacket worn by the deceased, and found a neatly folded 1447 yuan, a set of keys and a pack of cigarettes in the pocket of the lower body jeans, nothing to directly prove the identity of the things. Sun told me to put the phone in a separate evidence bag and put the rest back in place first: \u0026ldquo;Take the body back and check it carefully, it\u0026rsquo;s likely to be a case.\nDeep and shallow to carry the body on the bridge, the investigation colleagues immediately gathered around and asked: \u0026ldquo;Well? Is it a case?\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet, but you\u0026rsquo;d better be prepared. This cell phone for you, go first to determine the source of the body. Hearing the words of forensic scientist Sun, the colleagues of the investigation have expressed their unhappiness.\nBefore leaving the scene, forensic scientist Sun again saw the small civilian police, to him a frown: \u0026ldquo;can not be? Really a case ah?\u0026rdquo; The young police officer was immediately nervous.\n\u0026ldquo;It seems you have to stay at the scene for a while longer. The police officer said, \u0026ldquo;I need an autopsy to be sure.\nBack to the autopsy room, Dr. Sun took out two sets of disposable surgical gowns and handed me a set: \u0026ldquo;The first few times I saw you do pretty well, today you\u0026rsquo;ll be the main knife, I\u0026rsquo;ll be your assistant.\nUsually corpse inspection requires at least two people to cooperate with each other to complete, generally will stand on the right hand side of the corpse called the \u0026ldquo;main knife\u0026rdquo;, because the right hand holds the knife, then, from this direction to operate from head to toe, relatively smooth, and the main knife is also the main examination and report the autopsy findings of the person.\nDress up, put on the mask, gloves, first surface inspection of the body. After taking off all the clothes, what caught the eye was one after another old scars, and a tattoo was found on the arm. I and Sun forensic medicine with the body rinsed clean, towel dry water stains, Sun forensic medicine turned to take pictures of colleagues said: \u0026ldquo;the face and the tattoo first photographed and sent to the investigation, to provide them with some clues to find people again.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, you to determine the time of his death. Hearing the question of Sun forensic pathologist, my heart is a little bottomless, although these are learned in professional classes, but really put the theory into practice, or a little less confident.\nAccording to the textbook, the time of death in the early stages of death can be inferred from measuring the temperature of the body, but the body is soaked in water, relying on the temperature may deviate more. In addition to the temperature of the corpse, can also be inferred from some early corpse phenomena, including the formation of the site of rigor mortis, intensity, press the corpse spot can fade, check the degree of corneal clouding, and so on. When undressing just now, we found that the limbs were not much stiffness, pressed the chin of the corpse, and raised the head, and found that there was a little stiffness in the jaw and neck. The back of the corpse spot can fade with a light press. Pick up the tweezers to turn over the eyelids, the cornea is clear and transparent, no clouding at all.\nAfter doing the above, I silently thought for a moment, looked up at the clock on the wall: \u0026ldquo;I think the time of death should be less than 5 hours, it is now 10:25, that \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; probably died at about 5:00 this morning. The first thing you need to do is look at Dr. Sun with a little bit of weakness.\n\u0026ldquo;Not bad, theoretically okay. Sun forensic doctor first affirmed my answer, \u0026ldquo;but I think the time can be set a little longer, more than 6 hours it. The weather is not too hot, and the body is soaking in the water, in the low temperature environment stiffness will appear a little slower. And, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you noticed, at the scene, his face was dark red, at that time did not look closely at the injury or other, but now you see, the dark red face has faded a lot, so this should be the corpse spots, the back also appeared corpse spots.\n\u0026ldquo;I know! At the scene, the body is lying prone in the water, according to reason corpse spots should appear in front of the body, chest, face such, so then at the scene to see the face of the dark red should be corpse spots, but now the face of the corpse spots disappeared, but the back appeared corpse spots, this is the phenomenon of transfer of corpse spots. After Dr. Sun\u0026rsquo;s reminder, I remembered a phenomenon when the corpse spots first began to form.\nContinuing to check the body surface, there were some small abrasions on the face, mainly concentrated on the nose, the arch of the eyebrows, and the temporal region (located on both sides of the head, behind both eyes, and above the cheekbones, which is roughly the area near the temples). There were also some small abrasions on the back of the left hand and bilateral knees. The abrasions had a clear reaction to life, indicating that they should have been caused prenatally.\nThe body surface, apart from these minor abrasions, left the large trauma on the top of the head. I inserted a cotton swab into the wound and wiped around, and took it out and found some black sediment-like material on it.\n\u0026ldquo;This is no characteristic, the body is soaking in the river, the river\u0026rsquo;s sediment or something inevitably washed in by the water, if you find some brick chips, wood chips and so on can also explain some problems. Despite what Dr. Sun said, or let the photo colleagues to take pictures of the mud and sand above the swab fixed.\nI rinsed the wound with water and aligned the edges, and found that the entire wound was roughly in the shape of a \u0026ldquo;χ\u0026rdquo;, with the scalp and skull separated in the middle of the cross, and extending deeper to the sides, presenting a pouch-like appearance between the scalp and the skull.\n\u0026ldquo;The trauma base was uneven, the trauma margin was not smooth, and there were intertissue bridges between the trauma walls.\u0026rdquo; I reported these findings while examining, \u0026ldquo;This is typical of blunt force trauma.\n\u0026ldquo;And what is this pouch-like appearance?\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun asked again.\nI searched my mind and thought about what I had read in books and what the teacher had said in class, but there was no mention of blunt force trauma showing such signs, so I shook my head and said I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\n\u0026ldquo;I finally got it!\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun laughed, \u0026ldquo;this performance is generally caused by a relatively large area of objects, previously encountered an iron plate slapped on the head, also appeared this performance. It does not matter, forensics is practice, see more naturally know.\nThe next step is to dissect, after cutting open the scalp, see the sagittal suture of the skull (located at the top of the human head, a longitudinal bone seam from front to back) and the left side of the herringbone suture (a horizontal bone seam located at the back of the head) has been cracked. After removing the skull, there was a thin layer of hematoma outside the dura on the right side, and there was hemorrhage from the subarachnoid space in both the prefrontal location of the brain and the cerebellum.\nWhen I did this, I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;This was clearly hit with a blunt object of the type that the teacher just described, so this person was killed and then dumped in the river! I\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s it! This must be the case!\u0026rdquo;\nAfter the head, the thoracic and abdominal cavities were opened next. The surface of the lungs in the chest cavity had obvious indentation of the ribs, and there was a \u0026ldquo;twisted hair\u0026rdquo; feeling when squeezed by hand (kind of like squeezing a lock of hair and twisting it around), and red bloody fluid came out of the cut surface of the lungs. When the esophagus was opened, there was a small amount of sediment-like material adhering to the wall of the esophagus. The trachea was cut open and a large amount of white foamy fluid was found in the trachea. In the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum on the surface of the spleen was crumpled and the entire spleen was anemic in appearance. Other than that, there were no abnormal findings.\nAfter the autopsy, I was confused again: the damage seen in the head was enough to cause the person to die of cranio-cerebral injury, thinking that there would be no additional findings in the chest and abdominal cavity, but how come there were so many manifestations of drowning death by entering the water before birth?\n\u0026ldquo;Teacher, this person\u0026rsquo;s lungs showed typical signs of \u0026ldquo;watery emphysema\u0026rdquo;, and sediment and foam were found in the esophagus and trachea, as well as anemia of the spleen. These are all signs of drowning. I began to feel a little dizzy, so I had to ask the teacher for help, \u0026ldquo;The injury on this person\u0026rsquo;s head was caused by a blunt instrument, but this was followed by the manifestations of drowning. So, how exactly is the cause of death determined?\u0026rdquo;\nSun forensics did not directly answer my question, if thought for a while, decided to go back to the scene to see.\nBack to the scene, I and Sun forensic yards of highway, from one side to find the other, but did not find any useful information. Forensic scientist Sun and I were lying on the railing looking at the position of the body in the water in the morning.\n\u0026ldquo;Teacher.\u0026rdquo; I broke the silence first, \u0026ldquo;this person has a large head wound, such a large wound bleeding must be very ferocious, if it was wounded here, then the ground should leave a blood trail, right? Even if this is just a body dumping site, the transfer process should also have blood left ah. Could it be that it was floated down from upstream?\u0026rdquo;\nSun forensic doctor as if I did not hear what I was saying, lit a cigarette and still looking at the river dazed. I look at the water, and then look at Sun forensic, and did not know what he was looking at.\nA cigarette soon finished, Dr. Sun casually threw into the river, the cigarette sank in the water and floated away with the current. Suddenly, Dr. Sun \u0026ldquo;Huh\u0026rdquo;, asked me: \u0026ldquo;There is paper?\nI am more puzzled, turned out a packet of Kleenex handed to Sun forensics, he pulled out a ball into a small ball, like just threw the paper into the river, the ball of paper floated away with the current, and the direction of the floating away is - the second bridge pier!\nI stared at the ball of paper seemed to think of something, grabbed the tissue paper in the hands of Dr. Sun, also pulled out a ball into a ball and threw it down, the ball of paper once again drifted to the second pier there.\n\u0026ldquo;From the flow of the river, it really is floating down from above. I was a little frustrated, this kind of \u0026ldquo;river drift\u0026rdquo; often brings trouble to solve the case. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s even a problem to identify the person.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\u0026rdquo; I think this is not a case now, but I need to get the fire department to confirm a few questions first. Forensic scientist Sun took out his cell phone and started calling the fire department in the morning, asking questions about the riverbed and the depth of the water.\nAfter hanging up the phone, Dr. Sun said to me happily, \u0026ldquo;I have an answer, they told me that the riverbed under the bridge is different from the rocky beach on the shore, the riverbed here is flat, basically no rocks, just a big concrete slab! And, there is an important information, they went down in the morning, the deepest water is just to the calf, the river is not much deeper!\nListened to the words of Sun Forensic, I immediately understood his meaning; the body head injury is not at all hit by others with blunt instruments, but from the bridge jumped to the river high fall formed. Because the river is not deep, the deceased\u0026rsquo;s head directly on the flat riverbed formed the head of that large wound, and this impact did not let him die immediately, only because of cranial damage and fainted, after the drowning occurred, and finally washed by the water to the second pier under the location of the body was found.\nLater investigators retrieved the highway surveillance video, the video shows 4:42 in the morning, a figure appeared on the bridge, in the bridge from one end to the other, back and forth several times after walking, stopped at the guardrail looking at the bridge below, about 5 minutes later over the guardrail, and then fell head first. Because of the distance, coupled with dim street lights, it is impossible to see the face, but look very much like the deceased dressed. Later contacted the family of the deceased through the cell phone card has not been damaged, the family confirmed that the person in the video is the deceased.\nFinally, the cause of death on the forensic medical opinion was written: \u0026ldquo;cranio-cerebral injury due to high fall, combined with drowning death\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo;, my mind was limited to the first sight of the head wound, while preconceived notions that the wound was inflicted with a blunt object because of its obvious blunt force trait. But just like the final result, blunt force injury is not necessarily a blunt object to hit the head, hitting the head with a blunt object can also be formed, so that the \u0026ldquo;sac-like\u0026rdquo; performance under the wound can also be explained through, the flat riverbed acted as a special blunt object. Moreover, because of the buffering effect of the river also makes the body does not appear in the high fall in the often occurring multiple fractures, internal organs also did not appear obvious rupture, lost a lot of high fall injury characteristics.\nThis once again reflects the forensic not only to pay attention to the body itself, but also to pay attention to the situation of the scene environment, to avoid the first conclusion and then find evidence of the way of thinking, to think outside the box to crack the problem.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/4.hezhongfushifayiruhequedingsizhedesiwangshijian/","summary":"Those with distinctive features and multiple eyewitnesses of the high fall is easier to determine the nature of death, defined as an accident or suicide is a relatively simple matter, after the investigation there is no obvious doubt also generally do not need to be dissected; witnesses are sufficient, the family of the deceased usually will not have any questions. If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.","title":"4. Floating body in the river: how does the forensic pathologist determine the time of death of the deceased?"},{"content":"In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed. Originally this furniture city because of the remote location, closing time early every day, business has been difficult to do, today there is actually a corpse inexplicably appeared. Now it was completely out of business.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really bad luck,\u0026rdquo; Mr. Jin whined to us while leading us to the entrance of his store, pointing to the ceiling and saying to us, \u0026ldquo;Look, I was the last one to leave at 6 pm last night, and everything was fine when it closed, and now it\u0026rsquo;s like this. Hey \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; tell us what this is all about!\nAn hour ago, I was lying in my chair after breakfast, and the warm but not sunny autumn sun was coming in through the window. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to sleep like this, no phone calls, no scenes, no corpses, nothing! After a big stretch, I adjusted my posture, thinking to enjoy the beautiful sunshine first, and then work later.\n\u0026ldquo;~~~~~\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No way! My spell of \u0026ldquo;Flag\u0026rdquo; is working again! I wailed, grabbed the phone, and the voice of the forensic scientist on duty today came over the phone: \u0026ldquo;On site! See you in the garage.\u0026rdquo;\nNo way, death does not care if the weather is good today. In fact, this feeling of the unknown is one of the main reasons why I like forensics, I don\u0026rsquo;t always know what kind of scene or body is waiting for me.\nB city is really big, after driving for more than an hour, we crossed the whole city to reach a furniture market in the suburbs, met with Mr. Jin, and the conversation at the beginning happened.\nDr. Sun and I looked up in the direction of Mr. Jin\u0026rsquo;s finger and first saw two rickety fluorescent lights. The fluorescent lights were supposed to be hung by two chains, but now only the chain on one side was still hanging strong. Looking upward along this chain, the color steel tile I-beam on the ceiling was dented, and the dented position happened to have an I-beam passing by.\n\u0026ldquo;I came to open the door at 7:00 this morning, there was a puddle of soil on the ground at that time, I did not see it at first, so I swept the puddle away, what\u0026rsquo;s the impact? Boss Jin asked us a little shortness.\nDr. Sun took a look at Mr. Jin, waved his hand and said: \u0026ldquo;This is not a big problem, we want to go to the top to see how we can go up? Is there a staircase?\u0026rdquo;\nMr. Jin smiled bitterly: \u0026ldquo;This furniture city is built with color steel tiles and steel beams, just one floor, more than 7 meters high, at the beginning did not think to go up often, there is no special channel, only a small window can climb up. But I found this situation in the morning after also want to go up to see what is going on, from that window to drill up, up to see a black mass of things, get closer to see a hand. This scares me, I climbed down and called the police, almost did not fall down at the window! Jin boss took us to this temporary small channel, a ladder to a prominent platform, a small window on the platform, there is no protection measures, it does not look too reliable dangerous look.\nDr. Sun looked at the \u0026ldquo;temporary\u0026rdquo; channel, decided to call the fire department to ask for support. Ten minutes later, a ladder truck from the fire department came to the scene. After putting on the safety protection equipment, Sun and I were sent to the roof of the furniture city on the small platform of the ladder truck.\nThe roof of the furniture city is not a platform, but both sides with a little slope, far from the past, in the ridge a little bit off the location of the color steel tile has a pit, the pit has a black mass of things. I and Sun forensics carefully along the ridge of the steel beam to the front, you can see that it is indeed a male corpse, lying on his back, but the body is black, the head is also covered by the clothes can not see the face, but also a little seemingly odor.\nSun forensics and other photographers finished taking pictures, and I carefully approached to check. I reached over and pulled the clothes down a little, and what caught my eye was a mix of black, brown, coffee-colored face, and the stench was a little more intense.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I know it\u0026rsquo;s a person, and people are dead on the line. This is not safe up here, let\u0026rsquo;s go down and look at the details, first come help me put the body in the bag. Sun forensics said to me while laying out the body bag.\nLoad the body, we followed together with the ladder truck back to the ground, feet on the ground feels really good. The body bag was opened by Dr. Sun and I in a small open space surrounded by several cars, and the stench was even stronger than before.\n\u0026ldquo;It was bad luck that it was a corpse that had decayed. Although I muttered in my heart, my hands did not stop, quickly laying out the body bag on the ground for photography and inspection.\nSun forensic doctor looked over the body, I probe over while looking at the record: \u0026ldquo;gloves, footwear\u0026rdquo; have been formed, the fingers of one hand or dry state; body skin color because of corruption and black, some places there are small pieces of yellow, most places can not see the original skin color in the end what is. The top is in a state of upward cover the head, near the head to see some plastic bags, plastic bags in the middle to reveal a little hair, is a short thin black curly hair, a little like the black race is very common in the kind of small curly hair.\n\u0026ldquo;This looks like a black man?\u0026rdquo; I saw the hair after asking Dr. Sun forensics. The forensic scientist Sun did not deny, turned down the top to reveal the head, forehead position there is a plastic bag made of rings, loosely wrapped around the head. Sun forensics to the body left and right turned over, this turn, the plastic ring above the skull as a whole deformed.\n\u0026ldquo;The fracture of the skull is quite serious, it has broken into many pieces, I do not know if there are other fractures in the body, it seems to go back to take an X-ray and then take a closer look. Dr. Sun used his hands to stabilize the skull and carefully examined both sides, and found something stuffed in both ears, and took out small plastic fragments. I was thinking about what the significance of these things, I heard Dr. Sun say to me: \u0026ldquo;Come on, you deduce the time of death.\nMy heart was very apprehensive. Time of death inference is quite an important part of forensic work, inferring the time of death to determine the time of the crime, identify and exclude the suspect has no time to commit the crime, delineate the scope of investigation and even the final detection of the case are important, this work is quite dependent on experience and technology, need to rely on all aspects of information to make a comprehensive judgment, basically at the scene according to a variety of early body performance to determine the best Can be accurate in the range of a few hours, such as the location of the stiffness, intensity, such as the location of the corpse spot, finger pressure whether fading, such as the degree of corneal clouding, and so on - the actual work for the short time of death can be used to measure the temperature of the body to determine, this is still more accurate. However, like this time this has been corrupted, especially or has been highly corrupted, a variety of early cadaveric phenomena have long disappeared, if based on the changes in corruption to infer, the accuracy of this time may only reach the range of a few days. The time of death of highly corrupt bodies can be said to have been a nightmare for forensic pathologists.\n\u0026ldquo;This \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; this \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; skin discoloration is very serious, the gloves, footwear should be the formation of epidermal peeling due to corruption, these days has been 20 degrees of temperature, so look The words, almost \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; a week?\u0026rdquo; I replied with great apprehension.\n\u0026ldquo;I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s been at least a week, so you\u0026rsquo;re being conservative. But how come there are no maggots? I don\u0026rsquo;t see any maggots at this level of decay, but the flies have just come to lay their eggs. Dr. Sun pointed to a yellow-white fly eggs on the body\u0026rsquo;s clothes and said to me: \u0026ldquo;It seems that this should not be the first scene of his death. Let\u0026rsquo;s pull the body back and examine it in detail, maybe there is useful information hidden in his body.\nWhen we got back to the autopsy room, we took a full-body x-ray of the body. In addition to the expected finding of \u0026ldquo;crushed skull fracture,\u0026rdquo; we also found \u0026ldquo;four fractured ribs, two fractures and deformations in the spine, and multiple fractures and deformations in the pelvis. In addition to this, age-related information was unexpectedly found: the epiphysis of the corpse was not yet closed, and it was still clear! This means that he was less than 20 years old at the time of death.\nThe next step was the post-mortem examination. First was the clothing. When the forensic pathologist is confronted with a nameless body of unknown origin, an important task is to look for information on the body and at the scene that can determine the identity of the body, this body has nothing at the scene, now we have to see if there is anything on the body to prove who he is and where he came from.\nThe deceased\u0026rsquo;s upper body is two long-sleeved pullover threads, in a state of semi-dress, the left arm has come out of the sleeve, the right side is still normal wear; lower body two pants, the outside jeans are covered with black oil and dust, the button has disappeared, the trouser pocket nothing, inside is a gray fall pants and red underwear; feet are barefoot state, not wearing shoes, and no socks. Forensic scientist Sun and I took off the clothes on the body one by one, laying them flat on the ground, examining them and taking pictures. Sun forensics said to me: \u0026ldquo;Look at these clothes are Made in where, or for us to guess where this is from people to provide some reference.\nHowever, the results were devastating. The corpse was wearing a total of five pieces of clothing, two tops from Macau, China and Bangladesh, two pants from Mongolia and El Salvador, and the innermost pair of red underwear had no trademark information, but the front of the underwear had an upside-down \u0026ldquo;Fu\u0026rdquo; and a dragon printed on the underwear, so it was estimated that the underwear was from China. Originally, I thought I could roughly guess the possible countries from the clothes I was wearing, but this time I was completely confused: there were five pieces of clothing, but they came from five places! It seems that we can only go to DNA to determine.\nAfter checking the clothes and returning to the autopsy table, I noticed a small piece of orange \u0026ldquo;cloth\u0026rdquo; pressed under the body\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. Dr. Sun told me to give this piece of cloth to others to check the source, handed me a hose to rinse the body, so as to see whether there are any injuries on the surface.\nThe upper body is nothing unusual, but when rinsing to the lower body, in the left thigh inside found a large area of broken skin, the broken area has no epidermis, the muscles on the thigh are exposed, in the edge of the broken skin can be seen with the whole thigh at a fixed angle of the slope. Seeing this damage, Dr. Sun went back to pick up the pants and began to check the corresponding location, and found that the corresponding location on the pants but not broken.\n\u0026ldquo;I took a scalpel and cut a small opening perpendicular to the edge of the broken skin, \u0026ldquo;there is no bleeding under the skin, so to speak, there is no reaction to life, this injury should be formed after death. But the pants are not even broken ah, where did the injury come from?\u0026rdquo; I was already going crazy with this inexplicable corpse: first the inexplicable appeared in the inexplicable place, then his inexplicable identity, inexplicable clothes, inexplicable wounds \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; everything is inexplicable!\nSun forensics looked at my anxious look, calmly said: \u0026ldquo;Do not rush well, all the performance is certainly a reasonable explanation, just now has not found the key information that can be linked together. I see this leg injury is very much like the kind of squeezed friction formed, the pants are not damaged while the skin is worn out. Be patient, let\u0026rsquo;s finish the autopsy first.\u0026rdquo;\nI pouted behind the mask and patiently continued to do the autopsy with Dr. Sun.\nThe autopsy only found that the skull was severely broken, however the fractures were still not life responsive, which means that the skull fractures were also all formed after death. The stomach was empty, other internal organs were not found anything special, and because of the serious corruption can not be seen a subtle, extracted the blood in the heart, a small piece of liver and kidneys sent to do routine toxicology, cut off a small piece of rib cartilage to do DNA identification.\nThe autopsy is even a temporary end, but did not solve any problems, but let things become more confusing. The first question is: Who is he? Where did he come from?\n\u0026ldquo;The gold boss said only that a small window can drill up, that small window living people drill in are laborious, the body was carried up should be very difficult; if two living people to the top of the fight, was killed by the fall, but the time on the night is not possible to rot to such an extent, can make the I-beam bending, people do not have so much strength. And that pit, it\u0026rsquo;s as precise as tailor-made.\u0026rdquo; I silently thought of several possibilities, \u0026ldquo;and at the scene when I looked at the surrounding environment, the surrounding than the furniture city and then higher than the high-voltage electricity transmission tower, however, the closest one is also in a hundred meters away from the furniture city.\n\u0026ldquo;Forget it, do not think, we should go back to the scene to see it, the autopsy now get the information we still have to combine with the scene to see ah. Sun forensic doctor patted my shoulder and went out to drive away.\nBack to the furniture city, the cordon has not been withdrawn, the face than noon and also ugly gold boss saw us back, rushed to meet up and said: \u0026ldquo;You guys see if you can discuss, today because of this thing has been most of the day no business, now can not this cordon first withdrawn? I\u0026rsquo;m not doing business for a day, the rent really can not afford ah! Last year, a large ice cube fell on the roof in broad daylight has made me shut down a few days of business. This year, well, directly to a corpse, this shitty place feng shui problems, after the remaining months, next year I\u0026rsquo;m sure to leave, dead or alive, not to do here.\nI and Sun forensics heard here at the same time shouted: \u0026ldquo;ice fell on the roof?\nMr. Jin was startled: \u0026ldquo;Ah? Ice? Oh yes! Last summer, a sunny day, I was talking business that afternoon, a loud bang above my head almost scared me to death, when I climbed up from that small window to see, there was a big ice cube on the roof.\nAs we spoke, there was a roar above us, and we looked up to see a huge plane flying overhead. Jin boss then said: \u0026ldquo;We were guessing that the ice should fall from the sky, is not the aircraft on the do not know, but this happens to be the route of the airport, the aircraft passed quite frequently. Sun and I looked up at the sky, and in the distance came the sound of aircraft roar, a small black dot slowly turned into a plane, and finally flew over our heads.\n\u0026ldquo;Could it be that the body came down from the plane? I can not believe it, \u0026ldquo;the plane is flying in the sky normally, certainly not open the door to throw things, besides, the body is rotten like this, really who threw down, can not be rotten overnight like this, right? Dr. Sun looked at the plane that was flying over and instructed me to take a good look at the plane again.\nIn the distance, there happens to be another plane flying over, and as it approaches, the plane is getting bigger and bigger. Suddenly, a door opened on the belly of the plane and the landing gear was released. \u0026ldquo;Ah!!! I got it!\u0026rdquo; It finally dawned on me, \u0026ldquo;This is the landing route of the plane, when the plane flies to this neighborhood to release the landing gear in preparation for landing, so the body most likely fell out of the landing gear bin and smashed into the roof of the furniture city. In this way, the bent I-beam, falling fluorescent lights and dust, just the right pit, and multiple post-mortem fractures throughout his body, these would all make sense.\u0026rdquo;\nForensic scientist Sun nodded approvingly and said to Mr. Jin, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there should be nothing more over here, let me say hello to them and remove this cordon for you.\n\u0026ldquo;As for us,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun said to me, \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s go to the airport to see the plane on the ground, to see whether the landing gear compartment can put a person in addition to the wheels of the plane.\nIn the airport we looked at several models of aircraft, and finally found that those small aircraft landing gear compartment are very compact, closed and closed state is almost no free space, it is difficult to fit a person in. The landing gear compartment of several large aircraft has a lot of spare space, and there are several columns in the landing gear compartment of a certain type of aircraft, so when the landing gear is released, there is no problem for people to hide behind these columns and not fall out. The airport engineer also told us that the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s general flight cruise altitude will be more than 10,000 meters, the temperature will be in the minus tens of degrees, and very low oxygen, air pressure will also become low, landing gear cabin because it is not an airtight space, the engine noise will also be very, very loud, this environment is very difficult to survive.\nThe next day, before going to check the small piece of cloth colleagues brought back a message: the piece of cloth on that incomplete word is the name of a Hungarian airline, while last night from the owner of the furniture city to the discovery of the body this morning in 13 hours, the airport has a total of more than 140 aircraft through the route landing, which really has the airline\u0026rsquo;s aircraft, has gone to track down which one in the end.\nThis, combined with all the clues, explains the whole thing.\nThe deceased entered the landing gear compartment of the plane before she died, and also made \u0026ldquo;careful\u0026rdquo; preparations, covering her head with a plastic bag, earplugs in her ears, and wearing two layers of thicker clothing in the season when the weather was not cold. Although the preparation is meticulous, the material is very simple, just use plastic bags to protect themselves, and do not have any belongings on their bodies, clothing from around the world, presumably a person who may be wandering around the airport, most likely to sneak on the plane and chose to get into the landing gear compartment. But bad luck, chose an international flight, according to the level of corruption shows that he has been dead for at least a week, so it is likely that the first time with the plane has died on takeoff, only because of those few risers stuck to not immediately fall out, until this time may be because the plane bumps to change the position, again open the landing gear compartment to fall down. Unfortunately, because the degree of corruption is very serious, has lost the conditions to identify whether the lack of oxygen or cold and died.\nWhat a great \u0026ldquo;flying corpse\u0026rdquo;!\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/5.pingkongchuxiandeshiti/","summary":"In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed.

The body that appeared out of thin air"},{"content":"Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over. But for those who are still alive behind them, this death is likely to be a lifetime of pain and suffering.\nBeing a forensic scientist is not just about facing corpses, it is also about facing the living. I said in the third \u0026ldquo;Salt Club\u0026rdquo; that\n\u0026ldquo;The doctor-patient relationship is more stable in forensic medicine\u0026rdquo;.\nIn fact, even pathologists who work mainly with cadavers also have to deal with the living - the families of the deceased.\nPersonally, I do not have any special feelings for the corpse itself, most of the time, I just see the corpse in front of me as a very pure object of work, and does not cause any special emotional fluctuations, even those who died tragically, unjustly, and after the death of the body was brutally destroyed, as the object of work, I can maintain a rational and calm mind to face.\nHowever, when confronting the families of the deceased at the crime scene, outside the autopsy room, and after the autopsy, I feel particularly difficult. Almost no family members can calmly accept the death of their loved ones, the scene of mourning will even make me feel that the air around me has become sticky, depressing to the point of breathlessness.\nOr in the year of internship, one day after dinner received a call from the forensic scientist on duty that day, I was quite devastated. I was thinking that a calm day is so beautiful, and then play for a while to wash up and go to bed. The idea itself is a huge Flag, every time will fall without fail.\nThe scene is located in a residential building in the community, from the environment can be seen is a medium to high-end neighborhood. When we arrived at the scene, a friend of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s husband opened the door for us, and after entering the living room, we saw a person lying in front of the bathroom door opposite the door. The husband of the deceased was sitting on the sofa in the living room, in a state of disorientation, his eyes dull, his mouth constantly chanting: \u0026ldquo;Why should I buy! Why did I buy that thing!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I got a call from him at night and he said his wife had committed suicide.\u0026rdquo; The friend who opened the door for us said to us, \u0026ldquo;I told him to hurry up and call the police, I saw him like this when I arrived, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t asked what exactly is going on.\nIt was cruel, but it was important to find out from him what had happened.\nI walked over and sat next to him, took a deep breath, and asked him how he found out his wife was dead. The grieving husband sobbed and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Last night \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; last night when we were both walking around the neighborhood \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; she also assured me \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; that she would not go to the extreme \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; thing, both of us should go on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; well. Today \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; morning I went out to work at 7 o\u0026rsquo;clock, before leaving \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; she also said to wait for me \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; to return in the evening \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; back for dinner! As a result, I \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I came back at 6 pm to see \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; see the house lights on, I called out to her, but no \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; no one \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;promised, I changed my shoes after \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; turning in and saw her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; her hanging in the bathroom door, I rushed over to put \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; put her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; hold \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; down on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; call the emergency number, I am a doctor myself, I know \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; there was no hope, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept it. I just bought \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; bought that equipment the day before yesterday, I was thinking about good exercise, good life, and she ended up killing herself with this!!! I should not have bought it! If I hadn\u0026rsquo;t bought it, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been like this!\nAfter listening to his description, I feel very bad, before leaving home in the morning also agreed to dinner together in the evening, the evening back to meet not a hot dinner, but a cold body, who would have to grieve ah. His emotions also infected me, a time in the heart is also blocked.\nBut the heart is uncomfortable, but also to do the work. After understanding to him and his friends, the deceased was diagnosed with depression six months ago, and has been insisting on taking medication. Later to the hospital review, the doctor examined that the control is quite good. Probably because she felt significantly better, this wife decided to give herself off the medication until she finally died.\nAfter taking pictures of the scene to fix it, Forensic Scientist Sun and I went up to examine the body with good gloves. The deceased was lying on the ground in front of the bathroom, wearing a coat outside and a set of pajamas inside. The corpse stiffness has been formed throughout the body, the intensity is very high, the corpse spots are mainly concentrated in the legs, the back also has a little, fingers slightly hard pressure will fade. The whole face was dark red, and there was a silk scarf wrapped around the neck. After taking pictures carefully and removing the silk scarf, a wider constriction groove could be seen from below the chin to both sides in the direction behind the ears, which gradually disappeared behind the ears, and a \u0026ldquo;lifting hollow\u0026rdquo; appeared behind the neck. On the right side of the neck, there is a larger skin indentation relative to the rest of the neck where the silk scarf was knotted. The eyelids were turned over and there were dense hemorrhagic spots on the lid conjunctiva and some small hemorrhagic spots on the face.\nAs mentioned earlier, inferring the time of death is a very important part of pathological forensic work, and this time, because it is not long before death, it should be possible to set the time of death roughly to the level of \u0026ldquo;hours\u0026rdquo; based on the phenomenon of the body and the temperature of the body.\nAfter death, because the metabolism of the body has stopped, it can no longer continue to produce heat to maintain a normal body temperature of about 37 ℃. When the ambient temperature of the corpse is lower than the normal body temperature, the temperature of the corpse will slowly decrease until it is the same as the ambient temperature. This decrease in temperature has a certain regularity, and the way of measuring the corpse temperature is convenient and fast, and the accuracy of its results is more reliable, so the comparison of the corpse temperature and ambient temperature can be used to infer the time of death.\nThe measurement of postmortem temperature is different from the measurement of the body temperature of a living person often using the axillary temperature, the fastest cooling of the body is certainly the body surface, while the internal temperature of the body is usually used to measure the internal temperature of the body because it is less affected by the outside world. Most cases are measured rectal temperature, that is, the use of measuring anal temperature thermometer from the anus inserted into a section, and so the temperature stabilized for observation can be. Can also measure the liver temperature, the liver because closer to the body, the temperature accuracy of the rectal temperature will be higher, but the need to move in the body surface knife cut a small opening, not as convenient as measuring the anal temperature, so the vast majority of cases in practice is to use the measurement of rectal temperature to infer the time of death.\nI took out the thermometer from the box, first looked at the temperature in the room, after measuring the anal temperature and then looked at the temperature of the body than the house a little more than 8 ℃, usually in the spring and autumn season is generally the first 10 hours of death fell roughly 1 ℃ per hour, after the rate of decline will slow down, according to this temperature should be about 8 hours of death, but the stiffness seen in front of the corpse, corpse spots but not like only 8 hours Instead, it was more like close to 12 hours or so.\nAfter listening to my report, Dr. Sun said after some thought: \u0026ldquo;Because this is indoors, the temperature in the room is not very low, and she was still wearing clothes, the temperature may be slower to drop, can not absolutely rely on the temperature. Her husband said he had untied her for more than two hours, and you can see that there are only a little bit of new spots forming on the back, mainly on the legs, plus the intensity of the stiffness, so the time of death is about 11 hours.\nIn this way, the projection forward, it is now more than 7 pm, 11 hours ago, that is, about 8 am she has died. At that time, her husband had just left the house.\nNo more valuable information was found at the scene, and we explained to the husband that he would take his wife back for a simple superficial examination, not an autopsy, without destroying her body, to rule out the possibility that she had been killed by someone else. The husband was muddled, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he listened.\nBack to the autopsy room, the deceased on the autopsy table, the next step is to remove all the clothes of the deceased for examination. But Dr. Sun saw the husband of the deceased also followed in, Dr. Sun went over and explained to him again what we are going to do, and asked him to wait at the door first.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t expect the husband of the deceased to say: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I can understand your approach, I just don\u0026rsquo;t want her to lie alone in such a cold iron bed. I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave her alone in such a cold iron bed,\u0026rdquo; he said, as big tears rolled down his face, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t do it, I\u0026rsquo;ll take her off. I said, while crying and holding my wife on the autopsy table, one by one, I took off my clothes.\nThat was one of the most uncomfortable post-mortem examinations I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. In the past, when faced with abandoned children, brutally murdered girls, and innocent passersby, I had no strong psychological fluctuations, my work was just work. But this time, the emotions of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s family were like a big hand that grabbed my neck, making me feel like a lump in my throat.\nIn the end, nothing suspicious was found at the scene or on the body, and the conventional toxicology tests did not find anything toxic. The family of the deceased did not dispute her death and did not request an autopsy test. After issuing a cremation certificate, the matter is also considered closed.\nAlthough this was not a \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo;, I was particularly impressed by the scene: not by the dead body, but by the emotions of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s husband, who gave me a tremendous shock, the heartfelt grief, sadness and remorse for a long time.\n\u0026ldquo;Once a person dies, a lot of human feelings come out.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/6.sizhedejietuoshengzhedetongku/","summary":"Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over.

Death by hanging is caused by using all or part of one\u0026rsquo;s own weight to compress a rope or other similar object around the neck.\nThe majority of hangings are suicides, or self-hangings, commonly known as \u0026ldquo;hanging\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;hanging\u0026rdquo;. As a \u0026ldquo;star\u0026rdquo; death that often appears in various TV dramas, I believe we are not unfamiliar with hanging, so how exactly does hanging lead to death? And will it \u0026ldquo;spit out a long tongue\u0026rdquo; or not?\nWhy does hanging oneself lead to death?\nMany people will say, it is not simple, strangulation of the neck can not breathe is not dead?\nThis answer is not wrong, but it is not enough! In many people\u0026rsquo;s impression, the reason why hanging can lead to death is because the rope strangulation of the neck leads to \u0026ldquo;can not breathe\u0026rdquo;, can not breathe certainly can lead to death, but there is experimental evidence that the tracheal intubation of animals, in the intubation of the upper neck constriction can still lead to the death of animals. This suggests that even when the trachea is open, constriction of the neck can still lead to death, which means that there are other causes that play an important role in death.\nFor example, compression of the blood vessels in the neck can lead to ischemia of the brain, which in turn causes lack of oxygen to the brain tissue. The most common way to hang yourself in the film and television drama is to use rope-like items from the chin around the back of the neck, in this case, the neck arteries and veins leading to the brain can be completely closed because of compression, the brain\u0026rsquo;s blood supply is interrupted. Because the brain as the highest command of the human body, is very, very sensitive to the lack of oxygen, a very short period of time the lack of oxygen will occur irreversible damage. The sudden fall of the body may also cause cervical vertebrae fracture, resulting in serious damage to the spinal cord of the neck, which may not lead to immediate death, but the destruction of the spinal cord will cause rapid loss of consciousness. There is also compression and stimulation of some important nerves in the neck, which may cause the heartbeat to slow down or even stop because of the nerve reflexes.\nIn quite a few people\u0026rsquo;s perception, hanging is specifically referred to hanging, in fact, not only hanging, standing, squatting, kneeling, sitting, even lying down, lying down can occur hanging. Any position that can result in the consequence of \u0026ldquo;ropes to close the blood vessels and trachea\u0026rdquo; has the possibility of death by hanging.\nIn the constricted body will appear some more characteristic performance, can help the forensic pathologist to determine the cause of death. Such as the neck rope compression will form a constriction groove, which is one of the very important manifestations on the body of the hanged.\nAs in the TV series as the most common a white silk flying up the beam, and then the person hung up, some horror films will give a close-up of a person with his head down and a long tongue. In this type of self-hanging, if a forensic examiner comes after death, there will likely be such findings: the heaviest force on the neck - the deepest constriction groove under the chin, and then gradually shallow from the left and right sides upwards, and finally disappeared behind the ears on both sides. The two ends of the constriction groove here do not intersect at the back of the neck, and the constriction groove in the neck is a \u0026ldquo;U\u0026rdquo; shape instead of an \u0026ldquo;O\u0026rdquo; shape, and this phenomenon of non-intersection is called \u0026ldquo;tikong\u0026rdquo;, which was also called \u0026ldquo;eight characters not intersecting\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;not circumference item\u0026rdquo; in ancient times.\nIn addition to the most prominent constriction groove on the neck, the constricted corpse may also show some manifestations such as dark red color of unconsolidated blood, bruised internal organs, small dots of bleeding on the face, under the eyelids and on the surface of some internal organs.\nIn addition, in the typical death by hanging described above, because the blood vessels in the neck are basically pressed shut, the face may be pale, commonly known as \u0026ldquo;white death by hanging\u0026rdquo;; while in other forms of self-hanging, when only the veins closer to the body surface are pressed shut, while the deeper arteries are still supplying blood to the brain normally, this may lead to the accumulation of more and more blood in the head, and finally the bruising of the face, manifesting as The face is dark red or even blue-purple, commonly known as \u0026ldquo;green constriction\u0026rdquo;.\nIt should be noted that these characteristics are only possible, but not certain, in the case of death by constriction. The presence of these manifestations only suggests the possibility of death by hanging, but not absolute certainty that it is death by hanging. They are not unique to hanging, nor are they necessarily present in hanging, so they cannot be used as an absolute criterion for judging hanging.\nAnd about the \u0026ldquo;long tongue of the hanged ghost\u0026rdquo;.\nSome novels or horror movies often depict \u0026ldquo;hanging ghosts\u0026rdquo; as having a long tongue trailing out of their mouths, and some people have asked the question on Zhihu: \u0026ldquo;Do hanging people spit out their tongues? If so, how long can they spit out? Will it be as long as the chest?\u0026rdquo;\nThe answer is: not necessarily spit out, even if spit out, it is far from the distance we put our tongue out of the mouth.\n(Someone must have started sticking their tongue out to see how long it is! Take it back! Beware of catching a cold!)\nMoreover, it is only a relative minority of cases where the tongue is sticking out.\nSo how can we explain the fact that some of the hanged people do show their tongues sticking out of their mouths? When this is encountered during autopsy, it is described in forensic language as a tongue between the teeth, with the tip of the tongue exposed for XX cm. A corpse with such a manifestation would have a high probability that the constriction mark on its neck would be below the thyroid cartilage, which is below the male laryngeal node, a position where pressure would cause the tongue root to be pushed upward, thus giving the tongue the opportunity to stick out of the mouth.\nBut even if this sticks out, the longest is just a few centimeters outside the teeth, the tip of the tongue is certainly not a long hanging out state. This is just film and television works used to create the atmosphere to achieve the purpose of scaring people. Not to mention how after death, is alive, the tongue does not stretch out so long ah, stretching the tongue to follow the basic physiological structure well.\nIf the neck is pressurized parts in the throat above the jaw connected to the neck position, basically the tongue is at most the top of the teeth: tongue against the teeth and not out.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/7.ziyishiruhedaozhisiwangde/","summary":"In the above case, the deceased died by hanging himself in this way.

But when I actually watched a surveillance video of a self-hanging, the cold descriptions turned into vivid images, and I realized that I had overestimated my mental capacity.\nIt was a winter Friday, and I was already planning where to go for the next weekend (note! Flag up). I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to get a call from the leader when I was about to eat lunch, informing that there was a site for me to go with Dr. Sun Forensics to take a look. At that time, I was just secretly mourning for my weekend: my Flag how so indisputable, never established but half a day time. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even realize how much of a shock I was going to get on that very day.\nA father who lived with his son and daughter-in-law came back from shopping with his daughter-in-law in the evening and found his son hanging from the balcony in a well-known upscale neighborhood in B City. He rushed over to put his son down and rushed to contact an ambulance. An ambulance from a nearby hospital soon arrived, however the young son had already lost his life.\nWe arrived at the scene to see a male body lying in the balcony, some medical supplies used in resuscitation were scattered around, there was nothing special on the body, all kinds of typical self-hanging manifestations were present: the face was bruised and swollen, there were dense pinpoint-like bleeding spots under the lid conjunctiva, the neck was a typical constriction mark, there was a lifting hollow behind the neck, and there were no other injuries on the body surface. The scene investigation also ruled out the possibility of a fight with other people. In fact, it is a quite simple, quite ordinary death by hanging.\nBut the father of the deceased is extremely incomprehensible to his son\u0026rsquo;s death, originally because the investigation scene has let him first to the door and so on, but emotional he rushed in. He repeatedly stressed that he wanted to go to the supermarket with his son and daughter-in-law after dinner in the evening, and the son said there was work, he went out with his daughter-in-law, and when he went out, his son also sent to the door, and found nothing unusual at all. He insisted that someone must have killed his son first, and then hanged up disguised as his own suicide. Dr. Sun explained to him patiently, but the old father was particularly emotional, no matter how he could not understand, and also very dissatisfied with our explanation, that we are not responsible for the work, not serious, and insisted that we must find the \u0026ldquo;killer\u0026rdquo; of his son\u0026rsquo;s death.\nI feel a little annoyed in the face of such a scene, Sun forensic doctor is still patiently and carefully explained to the emotional old father, around the same performance constantly changing the angle and method of explanation. I could not listen any longer and started to look around the house.\nThis is a high-end neighborhood, from the home decoration can also be seen, the family\u0026rsquo;s economic conditions are quite good. I gradually shifted my eyes from the ground to the ceiling, and when I saw a camera in the far corner opposite the balcony, I felt that Forensic Sun could stop explaining.\nI went to the door, found the wife of the deceased, and asked her what this camera in the corner of the living room was for.\nThe wife of the deceased said that because the family\u0026rsquo;s economic conditions are good, there are also a lot of valuables in the house, because of security concerns installed cameras in some corners of the house, this camera on the balcony is to prevent someone from the balcony window. These cameras are usually always on, there is a special device to store the video.\nHearing the wife of the deceased said so, my heart has a bottom, walked back into the house, Sun forensic doctor is still doing work with the old father, listen to the voice has obviously anxious mouth, the voice is a little mute.\nI went over and pulled them both, let them all pause for a moment, take them to turn around together to see the camera. Dr. Sun conveyed to me a look of great gratitude.\nHowever, we did not know what a shocking scene awaited us.\nCalled the wife of the deceased also began to study the video surveillance equipment, the good thing is that this equipment is installed when the two couples together to study, but also to save the trouble of finding a technician to use.\nClick on the video recordings of the night, starting from the old father went out to see. The deceased did send his wife and father out the door, turned the door and walked back into the study. The video surveillance in the study shows him walking in and then starting to write something on the computer, because of the angle, you can\u0026rsquo;t see the computer display screen. After half an hour, he answered a phone call, in the process of answering the phone, he seemed to be getting more and more emotional, seemed to shout something into the phone, but unfortunately the set did not record, and do not know what was said.\nHang up the phone the deceased went back to the computer to continue writing, but obviously not as calm as before answering the phone, during which there were several times holding his head and began to drift off. Ten minutes later received another phone call, but this call seems to make him more and more calm. Finally, the dead man who hung up the phone sat in his chair for a while, and then slowly walked out of the study.\nHe slowly paced back and forth in the living room, after walking for nearly half an hour came to the balcony, took down the drying bed sheet to tear off a, climbed to the windowsill to fix one end on the window frame, and then put his head in, feet a crooked hanging in the rope sleeve made of bed sheets.\nJust hang up, his two feet began to kick, two hands also in the direction of the neck, as if to untie the rope around the neck, but just lift up to grab the rope around the neck, his whole body began to twitch violently, two feet straight up and up, the amplitude is getting smaller and smaller, hands also gradually hanging down, and finally feet finally once after hanging down.\nThe whole process of hanging myself was only a few minutes, but I felt like I had spent a few breathless minutes.\nThe hands that wanted to ask for life seemed to pull the necks of everyone present, and the scene was so quiet that even the sound of breathing was inaudible, until the old father\u0026rsquo;s body went limp and fell down.\nThis was the first time I watched a person go from a living human being to a corpse.\nBefore death by asphyxiation there is a spasm of the skeletal muscles of the whole body, from small to generalized ankylosis, which were learned in school, the teacher spoke of the theory, we learned only the bland words.

Hands struggling to survive"},{"content":"After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging? This is not all wrapped around the neck with a rope to let people die?\nIndeed, this kind of rope-like objects wrapped around the neck, through the application of external force, so that the rope-like objects compress the neck death is called strangulation, and hanged very similar. The difference is that the vast majority of strangulation is seen in cases of homicide, used to commit suicide is relatively rare. It is because of the two types of death, one tends to suicide, one tends to homicide, so how to distinguish between the two types of death is also very important for the forensic pathologist.\nAlthough these two ways look similar, but it is because the actual operation is different, it is bound to leave a different performance on the body, these performances may not feel much difference to the layman, but the forensic professional point of view is that there are some worlds apart, especially in the neck this key part, the formation of the two ways alone is not the same injury. In short, the forensic pathologist can distinguish between these two very similar deaths by understanding the case, site investigation, and finally combined with the most important autopsy. It is not so easy to fool the eyes of the forensic pathologist.\nMore than 700 years ago, in the Song Dynasty, the originator of forensic medicine, Song Tzu, dedicated a separate chapter to self-hanging, showing the long history of this form of death and the importance attached to it.\n\u0026ldquo;If you hang yourself under a house, first look at the place where you hanged yourself, and see that there is a lot of dust and dirt on the beams and trusses. If there is no dust at all, it is not self-hanging. First, use the staff to knock gently on the rope tied, if it is tight and straight, it is. If the corpse is moved, it will be moved slowly. If the corpse is moved and hung elsewhere, there will be two marks when the old marks are moved. (From the 1958 Law Publishing House, based on the edition of Sun Xingyan in the twelfth year of the Qing dynasty, \u0026ldquo;The Collection of Injustice\u0026rdquo;, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)\nTranslated into vernacular, it means\nIf one hangs oneself under a beam, one should first examine the beam, lintel, purlin, etc.: if dust rolls down from it in many places, then it is a real self-hanging; if there is only one place where there is no dust, then it is not a self-hanging. If the rope is tight, it is really self-hanging; if the rope is loose, it is the one that moves the corpse. Generally speaking, if the body is moved to another place for hanging, the marks on the neck will change and two constriction marks will appear.\nThis paragraph provides a way to identify the self-hanged or hanged after death, mainly based on the focus of the investigation at the scene to check the location of the hanging dust and rope tightness, or a certain amount of truth. However, these two can only be used as a reference and provide a basis for suspicion, and not as an absolute basis for the final judgment. The performance of the corpse on top of the latter is very useful. Similar to this, where the forensic conclusion must be based on reality, not just rely on theory to explain the problem.\nAs Lord Song said hundreds of years ago: \u0026ldquo;It is advisable to be careful!\nNot only in forensic medicine, but also in the whole system of medicine, there is this common feature.\nThere are no absolutes in medicine.\nAlthough we often say that the human body is a sophisticated machine, but this is only a metaphor, it is absolutely not according to the standardization of the machine to look at the human body, a lot of medical problems are definitely not black and white, one person can appear to be a manifestation does not necessarily mean that others will also be the same. Therefore, for forensic medicine, when making various judgments should be combined with all aspects of information, comprehensive consideration, not rigid thinking.\nFinally, the thoughtful Lord Song also gave a small example.\n\u0026ldquo;There are many people who are women, manpower, or outsiders hang themselves at home, they do not know the law, to avoid seeing the stench and avoid testing, so move the body out of hanging, the old marks move, resulting in two marks. The old marks are purple and red with blood shade, while the mobile marks are only white without blood shade. (From the 1958 Legal Publishing House, based on the Qing dynasty\u0026rsquo;s twelfth year, Sun Xingyan Yuanjian, a proof-text edition of \u0026ldquo;The Collection of Wrongdoing\u0026rdquo;, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)\nTranslated into vernacular, it means\nIn ancient times, it was common for maids and servants to hang themselves at home, but since the master of the house did not know the law, he would secretly move the body outside and hang it up again to avoid the stench of the body and the trouble caused by the official inspection. After this move, the original one rope marks will become two. The original constriction mark of the self-hanging is purple-red with bleeding, and the later moving constriction mark is white without bleeding.\nThis method of judging whether the constriction marks were formed before birth or after death based on the color and the presence of bleeding is very scientific, and in modern forensic medicine, the presence of bleeding at the injury is still one of the important bases for judging whether the injury is \u0026ldquo;before birth or after death\u0026rdquo;. 700 years ago, the ancients already noticed this point, which makes people today marvel.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/9.laizidasongtixingguandeqifa/","summary":"After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging?

,\n01\n\u0026ldquo;A body poured with cement\u0026rdquo;\nThis was Miyoko Kakuta\u0026rsquo;s last case before her arrest, and the one that best demonstrates her ability to charm people.\nAfter looking up a lot of information, I will show you how Miyoko Kakuta destroyed her family step by step, harvested her property, and killed people with a knife.\nAfter sorting out the case information, in addition to lamenting the fragility of human nature, I also had to admit that Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s methods are so high, the criminal psychological complexity.\nThis case is very top, after reading it, I believe you will have a better understanding of human nature.\nThe last victim is the 66-year-old woman mentioned at the beginning, Kazuko Oe.\nAn investigating police officer lamented, \u0026ldquo;If the Oe family, had not met her, perhaps they would have grown old peacefully and happily.\u0026rdquo;\nBut fate is always strange, you can\u0026rsquo;t predict which time and strangers crossed paths, will make their own destruction.\nThe Oe family is a very ordinary working family, a family of six people live on the land under the name of Kazuko Oe, Kazuko Oe is the only old man in the family, the second daughter Yumi and son-in-law Hiroyuki Kawamura have two daughters in elementary school, the eldest daughter Kaede is not yet married, the family life is ordinary and happy.\nIn 2003, the Oe family decided to refurbish the old house for Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s old age, so they built a small three-story building in the name of their son-in-law Kawamura.\n(Oe\u0026rsquo;s family chart)\nOne day in April 2009.\nKawamura, who was going to work on the Hankyu subway as usual, suddenly heard a cry of alarm from the carriage.\nKawamura rushed over and pulled the stuck stroller and the anxious Miyoko out of danger just as the doors were about to close.\n\u0026ldquo;This is a life saver, please be sure to come to my house and I will thank you personally!\nKawamura waved his hand in embarrassment, thinking it was his duty.\nBut Miyoko was very sincere, so Kawamura went to Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s house as a guest, unable to resist the warm invitation.\nAt this time, Kawamura did not realize that this would be the beginning of his future misfortune.\nWith the unique amiability and social skills of an older person, Miyoko and Kawamura then maintained a pleasant relationship.\n\u0026ldquo;It was a big deal to save the baby\u0026rsquo;s life, so I can\u0026rsquo;t thank her enough!\nWith Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasm, Kawamura was invited to her home at least 20 times, and the two of them gradually talked like friends, and Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s work-related matters were gradually revealed to Miyoko.\nMiyoko had a plan in mind.\nOn the grounds that the subway was mismanaged and caused the passenger\u0026rsquo;s baby to be caught, she filed a request for compensation with Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s workplace, Hankyu Subway.\nWith her justifiable reason, and Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s attitude of making a big deal out of it, Kawamura and her supervisor had a big headache.\nThe supervisor agreed to pay 30,000 yen in the name of the company, but Miyoko, who saw the possibility of the matter, immediately used a threatening tone and offered to pay 200,000 yen herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Think it over, or I\u0026rsquo;ll make a scene and let your company executives know!\nThe timid Kawamura wanted to settle the matter and gave Miyoko a promise under the disapproving gaze of her boss.\n\u0026ldquo;I really can\u0026rsquo;t get 200,000, so I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you 180,000 yen and give you 90,000 yen each time.\nLike most people, Kawamura, who just wanted to settle the matter privately, was the perfect prey in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nMiyoko knew that Kawamura would definitely be cold to her if she made such a fuss, so in order to bring her closer, she explained her reasons for doing so to the Kawamura couple at the dinner table under the guise of treating them to dinner.\nThe Kawamura couple also had two daughters, and as they were both parents, they could understand each other\u0026rsquo;s feelings, and the three of them ate happily.\nMiyoko, who had great social skills, used her magic charm and conversation to quickly win the Kawamura couple\u0026rsquo;s favor, and they remained friends for the next eight months.\nBut, it was just the calm before the storm. Miyoko was like a snake, waiting for an opportunity to move and had great patience with her prey.\nThe year-long friendship made the Kawamura couple lose their wariness of Miyoko.\nKawamura also used to go to Miyoko after work to talk, and occasionally would spill his family and workplace grievances to Miyoko, who gently expressed her understanding and enlightened him, while silently calculating in her mind.\n\u0026ldquo;What a poor guy, let\u0026rsquo;s start with him\u0026rdquo;.\nMiyoko then found a suitable opportunity to lend Kawamura 20,000 yen, without mentioning anything about paying him back, and said she would like to invite the Kawamura couple to dinner.\nAfter that, Miyoko and the Kawamura couple often get together on weekends, and Miyoko pays for all the meals, and never mentions AA, so that the Kawamura couple acquiesces that they treat themselves every time.\nIn the process of getting along, Miyoko conquered the Kawamura couple with her personal charm, and her goodwill level was already full.\nSeeing that the time had come, Miyoko started the first round of action.\nShe calculated the meal cost for several meals and determined that the amount was so huge that the other party could not afford it, so she asked the Kawamura couple for the previous loan and AA meal cost, knowing that the other party would not refuse her request because they were embarrassed.\nThe status of the Kawamura couple and Miyoko changed. The guilty Kawamura couple could not get that much money at once, so they had to apologize to Miyoko on their knees in the park, and Miyoko took this opportunity to punch and kick the Kawamura couple, expressing her disappointment in their family.\nShe also persuaded Kawamura to quit his unprofitable job and leave the troublesome family that was asking him to spend money everywhere.\nEven though Miyoko has gone too far, Kawamura and his wife are in the wrong, so they have to swallow their anger.\nWhen Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s idea of opening a cafe comes to her attention, Miyoko promises Kawamura.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead, I\u0026rsquo;ll take care of the land! I\u0026rsquo;ll take care of the land! Don\u0026rsquo;t be a big man and make a decision!\u0026rdquo;\nAs a matter of fact, Kawamura went home and told his wife that he was going to quit his iron job and open a cafe to make a lot of money.\nHis wife thought he was out of his mind and that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t take such a risk with two daughters at home.\nKawamura\u0026rsquo;s relationship with his wife gets worse and worse, and he goes to Miyoko after work to talk about his troubles.\nSeeing that the couple\u0026rsquo;s relationship is hardened, Miyoko seizes this opportunity to further lead Kawamura to resent his family.\n\u0026ldquo;Leave that woman who doesn\u0026rsquo;t support you! You two don\u0026rsquo;t fit! \u0026quot;\nMiyoko was really good at PUA, so she soothed Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s heart with her perfect lover status while fanning the flames for him to quit his job.\nIn April 2010, Kawamura resigned from his 20-year old job and bet the rest of his life on Miyoko.\nThe happy Kawamura must not have thought that his life was about to be ruined by meeting someone unlucky and not knowing people well.\nTo celebrate his departure, Miyoko gave Kawamura a batch of high-class coffee tableware, so Kawamura was full of gratitude.\nOn one side is not understand also complained about your wife, the other side is to support your dream of the perfect lover, if it were you, how would you choose?\nThe answer is obvious.\nKawamura was completely charmed by Miyoko, and he gave her all the 9 million yen from his company\u0026rsquo;s severance package, the millions of yen from his loan, and even the property in his name to open a cafe.\nWith her huge fortune, Miyoko happily moves into Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s house and starts living with Kazuko Oe\u0026rsquo;s family.\nMiyoko\u0026rsquo;s ambition was much more than that, she wanted to squeeze everyone dry!\nSo Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s family-destroying drama, which Miyoko had already succeeded countless times, was staged in Oe\u0026rsquo;s house.\nAfter watching Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s plan, I speculated that she herself must have excellent psychological insight, excellent social skills, know how to interrogate prisoners, and know very well the dark side of human nature, clean and crisp, extremely high psychological quality, as if hammered hundreds of times as skilled.\nThe first step of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s plan: to divest the opponents.\nThe first step is to turn the young couple against each other and pry the family relationship from the children.\nMiyoko was so uncomfortable with her opinionated wife, Yumi, that for over a year, she secretly instilled in Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s two daughters the idea that Yumi was not a good mother, and the daughters, of course, preferred the soft-spoken Miyoko to their strict mother.\nTaking advantage of her lover\u0026rsquo;s advantage, she also kept filling Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s wife with bad words. Miyoko, who had taken the dominant position in the family, called everyone up for a family meeting to discuss the Kawamura couple\u0026rsquo;s divorce.\nThe two daughters, already dissatisfied with their mother, watch the drama while expressing their desire for Miyoko to be the mother.\nMiyoko then forces her wife, Yumi, to give up custody and divorce Kawamura.\nTaking control of the family\u0026rsquo;s finances is like choking a snake by the seventh inch. In order to pacify the meaningless resistance, Miyoko called her cousin Lee Masanori (an accessory, later arrested), who was in his 30s, strong and grew up admiring the Japanese yakuza, to help Miyoko control the family with violence.\nNormally, if the robbery was purely financial, Miyoko, who had already taken the family\u0026rsquo;s property, should have stopped.\nGreed for money is only Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s surface motive, what she really wants is much more than that.\nWhat she wants is an experiment, a sadistic drama called humanity.\nWith the power of the yakuza, the six members of Oe\u0026rsquo;s family no longer dared to resist.\nMiyoko skilfully treats the family like criminals, strictly controlling everyone\u0026rsquo;s diet, work and rest, and even going to the bathroom for up to 16 hours a day requires her consent.\nMentally controlled + violently assisted, almost no one could withstand this double oppression.\nAlthough his wife, Yumi, divorced Kawamura, she was still trapped in the house by Miyoko. His sister, Kaiai, the only one who had contact with the outside world, was blackmailed by Miyoko with her family and had no choice but to turn her back on her fiancé and leave the company.\nSince then, the family has been completely cut off from the outside world and has no income, living only on Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s watch.\nMiyoko uses the experience she has gained in the first half of her life to further deepen the family\u0026rsquo;s conflict.\nThe second step of the plan: the collapse of trust.\nMiyoko begins her experiment with human nature, dismantling the family\u0026rsquo;s seemingly unbreakable bonds of trust.\nDisintegrating love, disintegrating kinship, she seems to be verifying something.\nHow exactly does she turn a family that has lived for over a decade against each other in an instant?\nThe tactics are simple and brutal: if you don\u0026rsquo;t listen, beat, beat until you listen.\nMiyoko asked her wife, Yumi, to abuse her two children in front of the family, and when Yumi did not agree, she was frantically beaten.\nAfter the wife agreed, Miyoko ridiculed the two children for their mother\u0026rsquo;s greed and fear of death, and the two children came to resent their mother even more.\nThe erratic Miyoko suddenly slapped Yumi in a rage, announcing to the family that only she had the right to beat anyone.\nThe family, shocked by Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s extreme character, trembled and did not dare to provoke her anger.\nMiyoko, who knew that the only way to break up the family was from within, encouraged everyone to rat on them, but anyone who was accused would be severely beaten, and for a while everyone was cautiously staring at each other.\nMiyoko knows human nature well, and she wants to subliminally influence the family so that they are completely enslaved and target each other.\nIn April 2011, the first person to be domesticated appeared.\nKawamura, who was already in a recent relationship with Miyoko and had maintained an affair, awakened the violent factor in his body after being disciplined by Miyoko.\nKawamura always believed that he was different in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s mind, and he wanted to prove to Miyoko that he was trustworthy.\nThe family under strict guard is beaten up even when they doze off. Miyoko finds out that her wife has secretly hidden a piece of chocolate and angrily beats her up. When Kawamura sees this, he joins in the beating to show his loyalty.\nPunch after punch was thrown at his wife, shouting.\n\u0026ldquo;Hiromi, just die trying to resist! Listen to Miyoko!\u0026rdquo;\nMiyoko was fanning the flames.\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t do that, use your strength!\u0026rdquo;\nKawamura beat his wife even harder, shattering her expectations, and the bond between them was gone.\nKawamura, who has become Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s right-hand man, has changed from being the ward of the family to being the ward of the family.\nThe family\u0026rsquo;s initial determination to secretly plan resistance and the relationship of trust with each other gradually disappears.\nIf there was any possibility of resistance in the family before, it has now become Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s plaything.\nThe most brutal part of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s character was completely exposed.\nThe third step of the plan: slavery stimulation.\nThe Oe family, who had been abused for a long time, gradually developed a Stockholm mentality. Miyoko saw the beginnings and made her violent control even harsher, knowing that she was close to success.\nMiyoko began to make everyone reflect on their mistakes by writing them down and reading them to them in violent detention, and then putting them in a small dark room where they were beaten with a special \u0026ldquo;punishment stick\u0026rdquo; that left them bloodied and disfigured. In addition, Miyoko degrades their self-esteem, bringing the Oe family to the brink of a nervous breakdown.\nMiyoko was so satisfied that the pleasure of controlling people\u0026rsquo;s personalities was the greatest pleasure she had gained in the first half of her life.\nJust 2 years after Miyoko came into contact with the Oe family, she had complete control over the family.\nIn July 2011, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s desire grew, and she also wanted to get ownership of the Oe family\u0026rsquo;s land, which was owned by Kazuko Oe, who was in her 60s.\nSo she tested Oe and Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s obedience and asked her to jump voluntarily, only to have Oe and Kazuko refuse.\nThis was not just a self-preserving refusal, but a humiliation of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s brilliant record, and from then on, Kazuko Oe became the target of a family group fight under Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s targeting.\nMiyoko\u0026rsquo;s supervision of Kazuko became even stricter.\nShe could only eat two meals a day, go to the toilet twice a day, and from mid-August, she drank less than 500cc of water a day, and even sleeping was restricted.\nWhenever Kazuko did not comply, she was beaten by Kawamura, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s right hand man and former son-in-law.\nUnder Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s control, the family gradually developed a pyramid structure, with Miyoko, who had the highest power, at the top of the hierarchy.\nBelow Miyoko is her son-in-law Kawamura, who is subservient to her orders, further down is her wife Yumi and sister Kaede, and at the bottom is her elderly mother Kazuko Oe, all of whom have the right to beat Kazuko Oe to protect themselves.\nThe Japanese houses were not very well insulated, and the neighbors heard the screams and called the police several times, but they were never taken seriously by the police.\nThe elderly mother, Kazuko, simply could not withstand the constant abuse, and the family\u0026rsquo;s first victim was born.\nIn the summer of 2011, at 9:00 pm.\nThe family punched and kicked Kazuko in a nearby park, a beating named by Miyoko: the family\u0026rsquo;s vent. The beating had been going on for 20 minutes until neighbors around the area saw it and called the police, who arrived.\nThe most brilliant thing about Miyoko is that she knows that the way to make the family completely cut off the idea of calling the police is to get blood on everyone\u0026rsquo;s hands and become a grasshopper on a rope.\nShe wanted to use the family\u0026rsquo;s hands to kill the disobedient Kazuko.\nOn September 11, 2011, under Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s instructions, the family of four beat the sleeping Kazuko again, and the 66-year-old Kazuko Oe was beaten to death alive by her daughters.\nAfter Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s death, Miyoko decided to fake it as a suicide and had Kawamura write the family\u0026rsquo;s suicide note, leaving all the land, property and house to Miyoko.\nMiyoko is also very experienced in handling corpses, and the first thing she does is soak the dead Kazuko in ice water in the bathtub of her apartment.\nAnd immediately ordered Kawamura to buy iron barrels and fill the bodies with cement to abandon them in the abandoned warehouse.\nEveryone is the murderer who killed Kazuko with their own hands, no one can escape and no one will call the police, which completely reassures Miyoko.\nHer sister Kaiai holds guilt over her mother\u0026rsquo;s death, which also annoys Miyoko.\nKaiai took Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s place and was targeted by the whole family.\nOn October 30, 2011, Kawamura and Miyoko tied up and imprisoned Ka Ai in a car near their apartment, leaving her to fend for herself.\nKao-ai, who was lucky enough to escape, fled to Osaka alone and gradually resumed her normal life in anonymity.\nSeeing this, do you think that Kaede really escaped?\nThe answer is no, Miyoko never let go of any opportunity to exploit a loophole.\nAfter Kaede escaped, she immediately ran to the police station to report the crime, crying and saying.\n\u0026ldquo;My important family member is missing, please inform me as soon as the police have any information!\nUnaware of this, the police informed Miyoko that Kaiai had changed her driver\u0026rsquo;s license in Osaka.\nThis time, Kao-ai, who was captured and brought home, never escaped alive.\nKawamura threw Kaiai\u0026rsquo;s body into the sea and was caught by the police as a result, after which Miyoko and the family were all arrested.\nBecause of the long-term dietary restrictions, his wife, Yumi, was on the verge of starvation when she was arrested, weighing only 70 pounds, and Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s weight had also plummeted by 70 pounds.\nEven though the evidence was overwhelming, Kawamura claimed his innocence at the trial on the grounds that he had lost his mind through Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s confusion, but there were signs that he always had a clear head.\nThe police and the judge, both became curious about Miyoko, who possessed incredible criminal abilities.\nUnfortunately, after her arrest, Miyoko committed suicide in the detention center.\n(Miyoko Kakuta, 64, at the time of her arrest) The investigator asked the family what they thought of Miyoko.\nKawamura said that although Miyoko had ruined his family, she had been more kind to him.\nKaiai, on the other hand, did not want to judge Miyoko at all, but rather regretted that she had beaten her mother.\nIt seems that even after Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s arrest, the family could not free themselves from the dominated spirit and even fell into a certain worship of Miyoko.\nThe Oe family, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s last case in her 25 years of work, is a mind-boggling but interlocking case, skilful and masterful.\nAfter looking up a lot of information, I found that Miyoko was just an ordinary woman in the early days.\nHow did Miyoko master these abilities and become a top murderer who \u0026ldquo;manipulates human nature\u0026rdquo; step by step?\n02\n\u0026ldquo;Miyoko Kakuta with a mysterious charm\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is the origin of this mysteriously attractive Miyoko Kakuta?\nLooking at her early life, we can see how a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer was formed step by step.\nIn 1948, Miyoko and her younger sister Mieko were born in Amagasaki City into an unhappy family with parents who often quarreled and a father who was a very powerful local contractor.\nAround the 1960s, many Japanese manual laborers came to Amagasaki to work, and her father let the workers live in his house, taking 40% of their hard-earned money and sometimes providing them with alcohol, and using \u0026ldquo;whips and sugar\u0026rdquo; to train them to be \u0026ldquo;obedient. The \u0026ldquo;whip and sugar\u0026rdquo; is used to train the workers to be \u0026ldquo;obedient\u0026rdquo;.\nFrom her childhood experience, Miyoko realized that people could be manipulated.\nWhen her parents decided to divorce when she was in middle school, Miyoko and her younger sister had to move from one parent to the other, living in a state of uncertainty.\nHer parents\u0026rsquo; indifferent family atmosphere accompanied her throughout her teenage years and planted the seed of distrust in her heart.\nAt that time, she was in the rebellious stage, and rebellious girls always seem to want to prove something.\nAfter graduating from junior high school, Miyoko, who wanted to live like an adult, moved in with her ex-husband.\nOn April 10, 1972, at the age of 23, Miyoko and her ex-husband registered their marriage and devoted themselves to being a housewife.\nAt that time, she, like millions of ordinary women, lived an ordinary life and took care of her family after marriage, but she also had her own insistence that she was determined not to have children.\nSuch a woman, what do you think she should be characterized?\nMy ex-husband, who lived together for 10 years, said Miyoko was just a very timid woman who would cry and cry when she got angry.\n\u0026ldquo;One time when I got separated from the subway at Kyobashi station, she cried and waited for me on the platform because she was afraid of getting lost.\nMy ex-husband couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that this timid woman would become the murderer of a major crime that shocked Japan.\nWhat made Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s amazing change was this next experience.\nMarriage didn\u0026rsquo;t really give Miyoko what she wanted \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nJust 2 years later, Miyoko, divorced from her ex-husband, actually opened an erotic bar on her own and was introduced to people offering exciting special services.\nThe bar was so mixed that Miyoko became acquainted with the local yakuza group and was covered as long as she paid protection money.\nHer friends in the yakuza gave her great peace of mind, and Miyoko was the first to call someone to deal with any trouble in the store.\nMore and more customers were put to rest, and the thrill of bringing people to their knees through violence made Miyoko revel in it. The long time contact with the yakuza allowed her to secretly learn the yakuza tactics of suppressing people and using violence to break down resistance.\nAs the owner of a porn bar, Miyoko also gradually learned the skills of charming men. After understanding the psychology of men, she became more and more sophisticated in her social skills.\nMiyoko\u0026rsquo;s life became more and more regular, and she played the video game \u0026ldquo;Kinko\u0026rsquo;s Palace\u0026rdquo; during the day and went to bars with her yakuza friends at night, so no one dared to mess with her.\nIn the area of Amagasaki Hangase, the \u0026ldquo;not to be messed with\u0026rdquo; Miyoko gradually became more and more famous, and some people even asked her to come out to settle some disputes in the neighborhood.\nThis life lasted for 15 years, and when Miyoko was 40 years old, she closed the porn bar for unknown reasons.\nAfter reading a lot of information, I analyzed that Miyoko joined the yakuza because she found out that the yakuza made money quickly and did not have to pretend with customers and enjoyed a high status, so she joined the yakuza.\nIn the years after closing the porn bar, Miyoko evaporated as if she had disappeared, and no one knew exactly where she had gone before that until she did her first crime and began her plan to take over.\nIt was only after her arrest and imprisonment that Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s true appearance, at the age of 64, gradually became known to us from the lips of her cellmates.\nThe woman who lived with Miyoko for two weeks in shared custody said she had a complicated personality.\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes she cries at night, talks to herself, and is an unpredictable person.\nWhen a prisoner was later brought in for the murder of her own son, Miyoko reminded her that\n\u0026ldquo;That woman is out of her mind, she even killed her own son, don\u0026rsquo;t talk to her, be careful.\nWith her normal outlook and unexpectedly warm heart, Miyoko is able to be a good friend to the inmates in the same room, given the huge contrast of the \u0026ldquo;tragic case of the extermination of the family\u0026rdquo;.\nPerhaps it was the years of running a porn bar that helped Miyoko master the skill of getting close to people quickly.\nWhat kind of person is Miyoko Kakuta? And what is her inner thoughts like?\nAfter field research, Kaoru Takamura, one of Japan\u0026rsquo;s top three speculative writers, believes that Miyoko has the shadow of an ordinary woman\u0026rsquo;s loneliness, an emotion that a murderer should not have, so Miyoko forces herself to strip away this emotion and becomes numb to everything.\nFrom her first days as a porn bar owner to her suicide in detention, Miyoko was always sober, she had a clear goal, knew what she wanted, and didn\u0026rsquo;t care about morality, law or even humanity, there was a negative and pessimistic side to her character from the beginning to the end.\nAfter her arrest, Miyoko repeatedly complained to the prison guards.\n\u0026ldquo;There is no point in living anymore, I want to kill myself, when can I die?\nFinally, on the eve of her trial, she hanged herself in the detention center with a rope made of futon and clothes, leaving everything for posterity to guess.\nHow did Miyoko Kakuta use her powers to become a \u0026ldquo;serial manipulative killer\u0026rdquo; that would leave the world in awe?\n03\n\u0026ldquo;The Hashimoto Family Test Site\nThe Hashimoto family was Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s first family to test the waters, and it was also the first \u0026ldquo;murder case\u0026rdquo;.\nAt that time, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s methods were still very young, and it took her a lot of effort just to find a reason to invade the family relationship.\nThrough this case, we may be able to find a glimpse of Miyoko Kakuta\u0026rsquo;s early days.\nHow did the Hashimoto family come to be targeted by Miyoko? It starts with Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s own sister, Mieko.\nIn 1981, Mieko used some kind of trick to charm the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s eldest son and moved in with the Hashimoto family, while Miyoko was running a porn bar in Amagasaki City at the same time.\nIn 2001, Mieko married the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s eldest son, and Miyoko became a relative of the Hashimoto family, by which time Miyoko had closed the porn bar and joined a yakuza organization.\nThis tragedy of the Hashimoto family was planned by Miyoko together with her sister Mieko.\nBecause the Hashimoto family was small, just a family of three, it was very well controlled.\nIn 2005, Mieko and her husband climbed a mountain, and while taking pictures, kept making her husband back up and fall off a cliff, and Mieko subsequently received a huge insurance payout.\nThe sisters felt that it was not enough, and Miyoko wanted to drain the Hashimoto family of their assets, so the plan began.\nOnce the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s oldest son died, the family was left with their 71-year-old mother and 54-year-old second son. The sisters violently watched over the two and abused them for six full years, during which Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s brother dated and killed the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s elderly mother, and in 2011 the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s only living second son was also abused and killed, and the sisters put the remains in an oil drum to destroy the body.\nBecause of the age and lack of records, the case was not filed by the police and has remained hidden until now.\nMiyoko inherited the entire Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s estate, and perhaps because the crime went so smoothly that even the police were unable to detect it, Miyoko felt a great sense of validation and learned from her sister Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s experience and prepared to commit the crime alone.\n04\n\u0026ldquo;A funeral that draws fire\u0026rdquo;\nWith the successful experience of the Hashimoto family, Miyoko felt that the matter of destroying the family and taking over the property was very feasible.\nShe begins to optimize her process and hone her PUA skills one family at a time. In the next two cases, Miyoko learns how to break up trust relationships from within the family, and she gradually masters the ability to destroy large families.\nThe unfortunate Kadokawa family and the Yokogi family become Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s practice tools.\nThese two families are huge, and both are related to Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s family by marriage, making them natural fertilizers in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nAt first, Ms. Haru, an aunt of the Kadokawa family, married into the Kakuta family and became Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eldest mother, but later divorced and returned to live with the Kadokawa family until her illness and death.\nAt Ms. Haru\u0026rsquo;s funeral, Miyoko comes uninvited and expresses her dissatisfaction to the Kadokawa family on the grounds that Ms. Haru\u0026rsquo;s funeral was too modest.\nMiyoko shouted: \u0026ldquo;A woman who marries a Kakuda family is a Kakuda family member,\u0026rdquo; which made everyone present afraid to make a sound.\nAt the funeral, there were not only people from the Kadokawa family, but also the Yokochi family.\nCounting up, the Yokodi family was the in-laws of the Menshe family, because Ms. Haru\u0026rsquo;s sister, Ms. Natsu, was married to the Yokodi family.\nThe dozen or so people present were then subdued by Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s boldness, and Miyoko, while pounding on the table, sharply counted the misdeeds of both families.\n\u0026ldquo;Haru is the one who married into our Kakuta family! She will be buried with my uncle, what are you going to do with the money for the funeral and the ashes?\u0026rdquo;\nThe two families had never met such a rude person before, and the funeral was indeed rather simple, so they looked at each other and didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do.\nMiyoko observed the reaction of the two families and continued her pressure.\nIn the following days, she gathered the two families together and called the juniors, the daughters-in-law, over for a family meeting.\nAt the meeting, Miyoko seemed to be looking for a breakthrough. At this time, Miyoko was still in an unskilled stage in sowing discord.\nShe discovers that her children are unwilling to support Ms. Ha, and that there is natural infighting between the two families.\nMiyoko was so happy that she knew Ms. Ha\u0026rsquo;s son could not repay a loan shark, so she promised to help him deal with his debts and used her financial strength to gain a voice in both families.\nThose years in the yakuza taught Miyoko the truth: first let others owe her, she can pry a bigger cake.\nSo Miyoko, who had settled the loan sharks, began to extort money from the two families frequently, and according to the investigation, in just two years, Miyoko pocketed all the property.\nThis is the end of the story, right?\nBut then, Ms. Xia\u0026rsquo;s third son couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford to pay back the money Miyoko lent him to repay the loan sharks and ran away.\nMiyoko was still worried about how to find the next breakthrough, and with this incident, she morally suppressed the two families.\nShe began to try to apply the same kind of regulatory tactics from the yakuza to the family.\nThe yakuza are good at interrogation, destroying a person\u0026rsquo;s willpower with various forms of violence, and Miyoko has learned these techniques to a tee.\nWhile violently guarding and interrogating the two families, she picked two of the younger ones to adopt as her sons.\nThe neighbors reported the case several times, but the police rejected it on the grounds that \u0026ldquo;internal family conflicts are not dealt with\u0026rdquo;.\nThe two poor families were torn apart by the endless abuse.\nIn 1999, Ms. Xia was tortured to death by her three sons, and Miyoko was already very skilled in the art of murder by knife.\nTakeshi Kadokoro gathered the courage to turn himself in at the police station, but the witnesses were too afraid of Miyoko to come forward, and the family was too afraid to confess because of their involvement in Ms. Natsu\u0026rsquo;s murder, and the last report, which ended in failure, was made.\nOnce again, Miyoko easily escaped the law. Having killed two people in a row without being convicted, Miyoko became more and more satisfied with her abilities.\nHer inflated self-confidence made the crime more and more rampant.\n\u0026ldquo;Which family should I start with next? Let\u0026rsquo;s do something more exciting!\u0026rdquo;\n05\n\u0026ldquo;An exciting blood slaughter\u0026rdquo;\nAfter destroying three families in a row, Miyoko slowly found the knack to evolve into a skilled murderer.\nShe knows very well that the families she can directly or indirectly hook up with are the best dishes to be harvested.\nTaking advantage of the weaknesses of human society and following the trail, she could always find the next family.\nSo she targeted her ex-husband\u0026rsquo;s circle of friends, using the natural goodwill of relatives to get close to each other.\nMiyoko went from picking the family to penetrating the inner circle with increasing speed and a steady and precise entry point.\nThe Kaikichi family would never have imagined that an ordinary exchange of pleasantries would become an invitation to death.\nThe Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s eldest son and Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s ex-husband were alumni from high school, and Miyoko quickly climbed into conversation with the other.\nIn 2001, the two met and kept in touch.\nIn 2002, Miyoko began to visit the Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s home several times.\nRemember at the beginning when we introduced Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s experience of opening a porn bar?\nMiyoko used her old ability to seduce men in this hunt. She was so skilled in her business that she charmed the Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s eldest son and invited the Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s eldest and second sons to come and live in her apartment together.\nIt is worth mentioning that this apartment of hers was originally the property of the Hashimoto family.\nAfter 11 months of living together, Miyoshi\u0026rsquo;s eldest son was compelled by Miyoko to quit his job and Miyoko began to reveal her true nature.\nThe two brothers who came to their senses succeeded in escaping in 2007 and changed their names to begin a long life on the run.\nWith Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s character, the rest of the Kaikichi family could not be spared.\nIn 2003, the 87-year-old mother of the Kaikichi family, who stayed at home, was taken by Miyoko to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, where she was imprisoned and abused to death, and her remains were buried near the Tanimoto family home in Takamatsu City.\nThe strange thing is.\nMiyoko never did anything meaningless, so why did she have to take an 87-year-old man all the way to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, which is very far away?\nAfter combing through a large number of cases, I found that Miyoko was becoming more and more skillful in manipulating her family, not only destroying families at a faster pace, but also maturing in her methods and abilities.\nShe even started a two-pronged plan to destroy the next family in the process of \u0026ldquo;finishing\u0026rdquo; the last one.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s right, Miyoko is imprisoning the Kaikichi family while looking for her next family.\nShe is no longer satisfied with eating the grass on the edge, she wants to verify something bigger.\nThe unfortunate Tanimoto family is the first \u0026ldquo;stranger\u0026rdquo; family Miyoko tries.\nThe Tanimoto family was Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s penultimate crime before she was caught, marking the full maturity of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s methods.\nIt was scalable, batchable, and so efficient that the process was already fixed.\nThe Tanimoto family and the Oe family mentioned at the beginning are very ordinary, ordinary people, and Miyoko can be considered strangers.\nHow to bring down a strange family? After thinking about it day and night, Miyoko cut into the family as a friend.\nThe kind and happy Tanimoto family of four could not have imagined that the family would be completely destroyed by this old woman whom they knew from one side.\nThe police information on the Tanimoto family murder is not comprehensive, after reviewing a lot of information, I will restore the most critical part of the case.\nMr. Tanimoto and his wife, Mrs. Hatsushiro, had two daughters, Jasmine, the eldest, and Rukia, the youngest.\nNo one could have imagined that years later, the younger daughter Rukia would become the murderer of her sister Jasmineko.\nNot only did Rukia recognize Miyoko as her mother and obey her, but she also married Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s adopted son and became a complete accomplice.\n(The four members of the Tanimoto family, left sister Rukia and right sister Jasako) In 2003, Miyoko frequently visited the Tanimoto family in Takamatsu City as a friend. In the morning, she was laughing and joking with the Tanimoto family, but in the afternoon, she went to the house in Takamatsu City to abuse the elderly mother of the Kaikichi family.\nWith the fat of the Tanimoto family, Miyoko was not slow to give the Kaikichi family to wrap up the disposal of their property and destroy the body.\nFrom controlling the family to completely appropriating the Tanimoto family\u0026rsquo;s property, this time, Miyoko took less than half a year.\nShe brought 10 socialites to the Tanimoto family and stayed there for half a year, violently driving the Tanimoto family to live on the second floor to prevent them from escaping and putting the yakuza on duty in shifts every day.\nLocking the defenseless women in the hut, they inflicted violence while mentally pressuring them with.\n\u0026ldquo;You should know exactly what you are, you are a disgrace to society!\u0026rdquo;\nShe made the family members write down bad things about each other, mastered the conflicts between each of them, called the younger ones out to talk alone, instilled bad things about the elders, and forced them to be loyal to herself.\nThe family then became a scene of holding each other back and targeting each other, and Miyoko established a new order without having to watch over it herself.\nEvery morning the Tanimoto family was forced to produce 200,000 yen in cash, and in just six months Miyoko took more than 20 million yen (equivalent to about 1.2 million yuan).\nShe made the family kill each other, taking the younger generation as hostages to threaten the elders to obey, and everyone was unable to resist.\nIn contrast, her sister Jasmineko was personally strong-willed and was not brainwashed by Miyoko.\nMr. Tanimoto realizes that there is only one chance to ask for help with this tight control of Miyoko! He found the right moment to pretend to quarrel with his wife, Ms. Hatsushiro, and took advantage of the chaos to let Jasako escape. The confused Jasako was ready to go to take the train to leave the city, but the train required identity registration and was arrested back by Miyoko on the grounds that her family was running amok.\nHer sister, Jasmine, is not at all obedient, so Miyoko has her sister, Rukia, who has been completely brainwashed, take her to her apartment in Amagasaki City and imprison her, where Rukia recognizes Miyoko as her mother and marries Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s son, becoming a member of the Kakuta family.\nRukia abused Jasako more and more, burning herself with a firearm and burning herself with a cigarette was a common occurrence.\nThe neighbors had called the police as many as 36 times, and like the victims of other cases, the police refused to investigate on the grounds that the case could not be filed if not reported by the victim herself.\nLike Kaiai Oe, Jasako was surprisingly lucky to escape, and she moved to Osaka to live her life anonymously and anew, unwilling to call the police because of her own involvement in the abuse of her family.\nJasako\u0026rsquo;s quiet life lasted for 2 years and 11 months.\nDecember 2006.\nAlso for the reason of changing her driver\u0026rsquo;s license, the police informed Miyoko of Jasako\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts. Jasako was once again taken back by her sister who had come a long way and was brutally abused to death, and her mother, Ms. Hatsushiro, was also abused to death by her sister in her old home.\nAfter appropriating all of the Tanimoto family\u0026rsquo;s property and stealing a daughter as a family member and killing Tanimoto\u0026rsquo;s wife and eldest daughter, Miyoko was completely satisfied to call it quits.\nDuring the same year, Miyoko set her sights on the unrelated Oe family \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nAfter sorting through all the cases, I realized that Miyoko did not start off with such a perfect crime.\nShe had periods of trial and error, but because she firmly grasped the psychology of the murdered families, exploited the loopholes in the police and the law, got away with it again and again, and refined her criminal techniques to perfection, she was able to create seven tragic cases that spanned 25 years.\nBehind the seven cases, Miyoko also has something different from ordinary serial killers.\nShe clearly came for her fortune, but then she forced the families, who were drained of their economic value, to die one by one.\nIt seems to be some kind of pleasure for her to break the superficial harmony between human beings, and to see the family members being suspicious of each other may be one of her motives for committing the crime.\nWhat kind of mood did Miyoko have to commit her crime?\nWhat was her real motive? With Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s suicide after her arrest, there is no way to know.\n06\n\u0026quot; The Final Trial and the End \u0026quot;\nOn September 25, 2013, the last case opened in Kobe.\nThe 25-year-long \u0026ldquo;Idea Serial Murder Case\u0026rdquo;, in which at least seven families were completely destroyed, finally came to an end.\nAll the members of the family who were directly or indirectly involved in the killings were convicted to varying degrees.\nThe Kagawa Prefectural Police Department, which ignored 36 calls from the murdered families, publicly admitted its inadequacy, and as the case shocked Japanese society, the Hyogo Prefectural Police and the Kagawa Prefectural Police set up a new department to analyze the inquiries received by each police station.\nJapan has also introduced policies related to disputes between relatives and neighbors.\nThe media have speculated about Miyoko Kakuta\u0026rsquo;s motive for the crime, but it remains foggy.\nRegarding Miyoko as a person, there are some contradictions in her unusual modus operandi and motive that feel reasonable but perverse that deserve attention.\nCombined with criminal psychology and police speculation, most murderers with strange personalities are used to living alone.\nInstead, Miyoko formed an extended family with eight unrelated people throughout the series of cases. From the narrative of the previous cases, we can see that she has an obsession with children and likes to adopt them. And this group of her family members rely on her to make ends meet.\nOn one hand, she is constantly destroying other people\u0026rsquo;s families, and on the other hand, she sets out to build her own family.\nMiyoko seems to keep proving the dark side of human nature and the fragility of love in various cruel ways in different families. This also reinforces her belief in the pessimistic ideas she previously subscribed to.\nEvery time she provoked family relationships, she watched silently. Sometimes with silent tears on the sidelines, other times with a self-deprecating smile.\nFor 25 years, the collapse of every family seemed to start with the provocation of the couple\u0026rsquo;s relationship, and every couple\u0026rsquo;s family was her testing ground. And each couple\u0026rsquo;s relationship eventually, not surprisingly, broke down, with both sides even fist-fighting.\nAs events progress to a later stage, this break-up gradually rises again between the two generations, intensifying. Throughout the spectatorship, Miyoko seems to be watching everything from God\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nCombined with Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s family of origin and early childhood experiences, one cannot help but venture a guess that Miyoko may have been subconsciously reverting to the traumatic experiences of her childhood, to the episodes where her family had a significant impact on her psyche.\nPerhaps she is verifying, trying to repeatedly confirm whether there is a true love that will not break, whether there is a love in the family that can never be provoked?\nOr maybe she is just making herself admit over and over again in a case that really happened, admitting that the pessimism in her own eyes is what the world was supposed to be like \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nPerhaps the world in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eyes can be touched with one sentence.\nWhen you get used to pessimism, it can be as pleasant as optimism.\n\u0026ndash; Bennett\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/9gezhijirenxingheianmiandizhenshianjian1/","summary":"If you are an ordinary 64-year-old grandmother, want to effortlessly screw up 7 families, what should you do?\nEat people\u0026rsquo;s money, make the man obsessed with the old and decrepit you and the beautiful wife divorce, even do not even want to work, give you the house property, without your own hands, so that all the people who do not listen to you are killed.\nPretty golden handshake, right?\nIn reality, can it really be done?","title":"Manipulation of the human mind | Japanese intentional murder case: the 64-year-old woman's borrowed knife to kill 10 people"}]
