[{"content":"In the history of the Qing Dynasty, there are two powerful women with whom we are most familiar. One was Empress Dowager Cixi, the birth mother of the Tongzhi Emperor, who held the power of the dynasty for nearly half a century and was the de facto ruler of China during the late Qing Dynasty; the other was Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, the birth mother of the Shunzhi Emperor, who trained and assisted two generations of emperors, Shunzhi and Kangxi, and was an outstanding politician in the early Qing Dynasty. The lives of these two women brought a decisive impact on the rise and fall of the Qing dynasty. But compared to Cixi\u0026rsquo;s rise to power, Xiaozhuang\u0026rsquo;s path was much more tortuous.\nAt the age of thirteen, Xiaozhuang was given to Huang taiji by her brother in an uncompromising political marriage. At first, she was Huang taiji sealed as side Fujin, later Huang taiji inherited the Khanate, and she was sealed as the Western Palace Fujin, second only to the Grand Fujin Erdene Qiqiege. But with the expansion of Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s harem, filial piety\u0026rsquo;s status gradually decline, even in Huang taiji emperor ranked to the end of the consort (west side Fujin), was only sealed as Zhuang Fei. Even later gave birth to the emperor\u0026rsquo;s ninth son Fulin, later the Shunzhi Emperor, filial piety Zhuang in the harem\u0026rsquo;s status has not been able to rise.\nBecause Huang taiji from the bottom of his heart actually did not like Xiao Zhuang, and above Xiao Zhuang Na Mu Zhong (West Grand Fujin) and Batma (East Side Fujin), are the widow of Mongolia Lindan Khan, these two women in marriage to Huang taiji, brought a lot of Lindan Khan\u0026rsquo;s clan and property, marry these two women, for Huang taiji in enlisting the Mongolian clan to provide great help, so their status in the harem, so they are not low. naturally will not be low. Further up, is long settled in the position of the Palace of Erdeni Qiqiege (king Fujin), and Xiaozhuang\u0026rsquo;s sister, Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s life\u0026rsquo;s favorite woman Hailanzhu (East Grand Fujin), in the last position of Xiaozhuang, is not qualified to compare with them.\nHere, we want to focus on the relationship between Hailanzhu and Huang taiji. This woman married Huang taiji, is already 26 years old, Qing history experts generally believe that Hailanzhu and the two widows of lindan Khan, like the previous experience of marriage. But Huang taiji and hailanzhu\u0026rsquo;s union, not as another ordinary political marriage, but to give her the status of the harem number two. In Hailanzhu for him to give birth to the eighth son, Huang taiji is openly declared the child as the Crown Prince, but unfortunately the child did not live long before he passed away. Despite this, Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s love for Hailanzhu did not decrease by half.\nLater Hailanzhu fell ill, learned the news of Huang taiji, at that time was led by Hong Chengchou and the Ming army in Songshan, Jinzhou duel, in order to accompany Hailanzhu, Huang taiji made a very irrational decision, put the front tens of thousands of troops in danger, day and night to rush back to Shengjing. It is said that Huang taiji on the road because of riding bumps, high blood pressure attack, nosebleeds can not stop flowing, he took a bowl on the horse then nosebleeds, full on pouring, do not care about their health. But even so, he did not catch a last glimpse of Hailanzhu, walking outside of Shengjing, Hailanzhu has died of illness. Grief, Huang taiji, so cry faint on the ground, for several days without food and drink, even later the Qing army captured Hong Chengchou, Zu Dashou, for the surrender of the two celebrated, Huang taiji because to mourn Hailanzhu, did not show up.\nIn contrast, Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s favor to Xiaozhuang during his lifetime, almost negligible, there is no record in the history books about the feelings between Xiaozhuang and Huang taiji. But this is a harem of \u0026ldquo;small transparent\u0026rdquo;, after the death of Huang taiji but step by step to the fore, became the key figure in the early Qing dynasty national process.\nThe turning point in the fate of Xiaozhuang\u0026rsquo;s life occurred on September 21, 1643 AD.\nOn that day, the Qing emperor Huang taiji died suddenly in Shengjing at the age of 52. Because of the suddenness of the incident, he did not leave a will before his death, the issue of successor to the throne, became the focus of discussion.\nAt that time, the most powerful successor to the throne are two people. One is Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s big brother, in charge of the Ministry of household affairs Su Prince Hauge, support him, mainly by Huang taiji direct command of the two yellow banners and blue banner generals, as well as Turg, Sony, Tu Lai, Ao Bai and a number of important courtiers. They believe that Hauge has made a lot of war, before Huang taiji was already Heshuo Baylor, after the emperor and promoted to Prince of Su, and his uncles on an equal footing, enough to prove that Huang taiji is willing to train him to succeed the throne.\nThe other is Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s brother, in charge of the Ministry of Rui Prince Dorgon, and Hauge compared to Dorgon, although not Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s children, but the generation is high, and more merit, two of his own brothers Azig and Doduo is also his hardcore supporters, has a white, set white two strong flag, many members of the clan also secretly support Dorgon ascension to the throne. These two groups of people for power, there was a sharp confrontation, once to the point of saber-rattling. At the time of the meeting, the two yellow banner ministers even entered the palace with weapons, claiming that if the eight banner masters choose someone other than Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s son as emperor, then they have to kill themselves on the spot and follow the late emperor. Although the words are so said, but from the standpoint of Dorgon and other people listening, that means too clear: you Dorgon dare to touch the throne, we two yellow flag people fight for their lives, but also to kill you!\nAt this time, dorgon and hoge outside the third force came forward, the final attribution of the throne played a decisive role in guiding. Their names, is Dai Shan and Jierhalang. Dai Shan the man, as we mentioned earlier, is Nurhachu\u0026rsquo;s Great Baylor, he and his sons commanded the two red banners. In the eight banner king kilometers, Dai Shan\u0026rsquo;s seniority is the oldest, the highest status, strength is actually the most powerful in each flag lord. But after years of wind and rain polished Dai Shan, at this moment has nothing to covet the throne, someone in the meeting proposed to embrace him as the emperor, also by Dai Shan directly refused, and in between Dorgon, Hauge two people, Dai Shan also did not have a clear statement of which side to support.\nIn contrast, the flag owner of the paneled blue banner Jierhalang, although usually obsequious, a good old-fashioned look, but at this time showed a calm and sophisticated side. He believes that, although Hauge is more qualified than Dorgon to succeed the throne, but in the strength of the latter is not as good, and must be elected from the two people, the other side is bound to fierce opposition, is not conducive to the unity of the eight banners. Therefore, Jierhalang proposed a compromise program, embracing the same Huang taiji son of Fulin succeeded to the throne, before Fulin grows up to rule, by him and Dorgon jointly assist the government. In this way, loyal to Huang taiji Jierhalang, to ensure that Hauge and other people will not be Dorgon group retaliation, and Dorgon\u0026rsquo;s people do not have to worry about being liquidated.\nSure enough, this proposal was approved by all parties. Little Fulin\u0026rsquo;s birth mother Zhuang Fei, was also able to and Huang taiji\u0026rsquo;s Palace Queen of the two houses and honor, when the Empress Dowager. Later, with the Qing army, the sudden death of Dorgon, Kangxi reign and a series of events, the status of the Empress Dowager Xiao Zhuang also higher and higher, and finally got \u0026ldquo;unified two dynasties of filial piety, extremely three generations of respect for relatives,\u0026rdquo; the lofty status.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/13.huangtaijibushenchongaidexiaozhuangshiruhedengshangdianfengde/","summary":"In the history of the Qing Dynasty, there are two powerful women with whom we are most familiar.

Huang taiji not very favored xiaozhuang, how to get to the top"},{"content":"V zgodovini dinastije Qing sta nam najbolj znani dve močni ženski. Ena je bila cesarica vdova Cixi, rodna mati cesarja Tongzhi, ki je skoraj pol stoletja držala vajeti oblasti in bila dejanska vladarica Kitajske v času pozne dinastije Qing; druga je bila cesarica vdova Xiao Zhuang, rodna mati cesarja Shunzhi, ki je vzgajala dve generaciji cesarjev, Shunzhi in Kangxi, in jima pomagala ter bila izjemna državnica v začetku dinastije Qing. Življenje teh dveh žensk je odločilno vplivalo na vzpon in padec dinastije Qing. Toda v primerjavi s Cixijinim vzponom na oblast je bila Xiaozhuangova pot veliko bolj ovinkasta.\nPri trinajstih letih je brat Xiaozhuang dal Huang taiji v brezkompromisno politično poroko. Najprej jo je Huang taiji imenoval za stransko fudžino, pozneje pa je prevzel oblast v kanu in jo imenoval za fudžino zahodne palače, drugo po veliki fudžini Erdene Qiqiege. Toda s širjenjem Huang taijijevega harema se je status Xiao Zhuang postopoma zmanjševal, tudi ko je bil Huang taiji cesar uvrščen na koncu konzorcija (Western Fujin), je bil imenovan le Zhuang Fei. Tudi po rojstvu devetega sina cesarja Fulina, kasnejšega cesarja Shunzhi, se položaj Xiao Zhuang v haremu ni vrnil.\nHuang taiji Xiaozhuang iz vsega srca ni imel preveč rad, poleg tega pa sta bili obe ženski nad njo, Na Mu Zhong (zahodna velika Fujin) in Batma (vzhodna stranska Fujin), vdovi mongolskega Lindan Khana, ki sta ob poroki s Huang taijijem s seboj prinesli veliko število Lindan Khanovih klanov in premoženja. Njun status v haremu seveda ni bil nizek. Zadnji dve ženski, ki sta bili že trdno v glavni palači, sta bili Erdeni Qiqiege (vladarjeva Fujin) in Hailanzhu (vzhodna velika Fujin), Xiaozhuangova sestra in ženska, ki jo je Huang taiji v življenju najbolj ljubil, Xiaozhuang, ki je bil na dnu seznama, pa se z njima ni mogel primerjati.\nTu se bomo osredotočili na odnos med Hailanzhujem in Huang taijijem. Ta ženska je bila stara že 26 let, ko se je poročila s Huang Taijijem, in strokovnjaki za zgodovino Qing menijo, da je bila Hailanzhu, tako kot dve vdovi Lindan Khana, zagotovo poročena že prej. Toda Huang taiji na svojo zvezo s Hailanzhu ni gledal kot na še eno navadno politično poroko, temveč ji je dodelil status številke dve v haremu. Ko je Hailanzhu rodil osmega sina, je Huang taiji odkrito izjavil, da bo otrok postal kronski princ, vendar žal ni dolgo živel, preden je umrl. Kljub temu se Huang taijijeva ljubezen do Hailanzhuja ni zmanjšala niti za polovico.\nKasneje je Hailanzhu zbolel in Huang taiji je bil obveščen o novici. V tistem času je bil vpleten v dvoboj z vojsko Ming, ki jo je vodil Hong Chengchou, na območju Songshan in Jinzhou, da bi spremljal Hailanzhuja, je Huang taiji sprejel zelo nerazumno odločitev, da zanemari varnost več deset tisoč vojakov na fronti in dan in noč potuje nazaj v Shengjing. Pravijo, da je Huang taiji na cesti zaradi neravne vožnje, visokega krvnega tlaka napad, krvavitve iz nosu ne more prenehati teči, je vzel skledo na konja krvavitve iz nosu, polno na izlivanje, ne skrbi za njihovo zdravje. A kljub temu mu ni uspelo, da bi še zadnjič videl Hailanzhuja, in ko je prišel na obrobje Shengjinga, je Hailanzhu že umrl. Žalujoči Huang taiji, ki je jokal na tleh, več dni ni ne jedel ne pil, tudi ko je vojska Qing kasneje zajela Hong Chengchouja in Zu Dashouja, se Huang taiji ni pojavil, ker je moral žalovati za Hailanzhujem, da bi proslavil njuno predajo.\nNasprotno pa je Huang taiji v času svojega življenja Xiaozhuangu izkazal skoraj zanemarljivo naklonjenost, v zgodovinskih knjigah pa ni zapisov o čustvih med Xiaozhuangom in Huang taijijem. Toda prav ta \u0026ldquo;mala preglednica\u0026rdquo; v haremu je po Huang taijijevi smrti postala ključna osebnost pri oblikovanju države na začetku dinastije Qing.\nPrelomni trenutek v Siaožujangovem življenju se je zgodil 21. septembra 1643.\nTega dne je v Šengdžingu pri dvainpetdesetih letih nenadoma umrl Huang Taiji, cesar Qing. Zaradi nenadnega dogodka pred smrtjo ni zapustil oporoke, vprašanje prestolonaslednika pa je postalo osrednja tema razprav med civilnimi in vojaškimi oblastmi.\nTakrat sta bila najmočnejša naslednika prestola dve osebi. Eden je Huang taiji je najstarejši brat, odgovoren za ministrstvo za gospodinjske zadeve princa Su Hoge, ga podpirajo, predvsem Huang taiji neposredno poveljstvo dveh rumenih praporov in modrega prapora generalov, kot tudi Turg, Sony, Tu Lai, Ao Bai in številne pomembne dvorjani. Trdili so, da je Hauge dosegel veliko vojnih dosežkov, da je bil že, preden je Huang taiji postal cesar, član Heshuo beile in da je bil po tem, ko je postal cesar, povišan v princa Su, enakega svojim stricem, kar dokazuje, da ga je Huang taiji želel usposobiti za naslednika prestola.\nDrugi je mlajši brat Huang taiji, odgovoren za ministrstvo Rui Prince Dorgon, in Hauge, Dorgon ni sin Huang taiji, ampak starejši, ampak tudi več zaslug, dva od svojih bratov Azig in Doduo je tudi njegov hardcore podporniki, z belo, nastavite belo dve močni zastavi, mnogi člani klana so tudi na skrivaj podpirajo Dorgon, da se povzpne na prestol. Ti dve skupini ljudi sta se ostro spopadli za oblast in v nekem trenutku je prišlo do sabljanja. Med sestankom so ministri dveh rumenih praporov celo vstopili v palačo z orožjem in trdili, da se bodo morali ubiti na kraju samem in slediti pokojnemu cesarju, če bo osem mojstrov praporov za cesarja izbralo koga drugega kot Huang Taijijevega sina. Čeprav so besede tako rečeno, ampak s stališča Dorgon in drugi slišati, pomen je preveč jasno: ti Dorgon upam dotakniti prestol, smo dva rumena prapor ljudje tvegajo svoja življenja, ampak tudi, da vas ubije!\nV tem času sta Dorgon in Hauge zunaj tretje sile izstopala, končni cilj prestola pa je imel odločilno vlogo pri vodenju. Njuni imeni sta bili Daishon in Ji\u0026rsquo;erhalang. Dai Shan, človek, ki je bil, kot smo že omenili, Nurhačijev veliki bajle, je skupaj s svojimi sinovi poveljeval dvema rdečima praporoma. On in njegovi sinovi so bili odgovorni za dve rdeči zastavi. Med osmimi kralji zastav je bil Daishon najstarejši in najmočnejši, pravzaprav najmočnejši med vsemi mojstri zastav. Toda po letih vetra in dežja poliranje, na tej točki v tem času nima ničesar, da bi hrepenel prestol, nekdo na sestanku, da ga podpirajo kot cesar, ampak tudi Dai Shan naravnost zavrnil, in med Dorgon, Hauge dva, Dai Shan tudi ni dal jasno izjavo, da podpirajo katero stran.\nJierhalang, poveljnik prapora vsejmodrega prapora, je bil sicer običajno ustrežljiv in dober starček, vendar je tokrat pokazal mirno in prefinjeno plat. Prepričan je, da je Hauge sicer bolj usposobljen za prestol kot Dorgon, vendar ni tako močan kot slednji, in če bo treba izbrati enega od njiju, mu bo druga stran ostro nasprotovala, kar ne bo prispevalo k enotnosti osmih praporov. Zato je Ji\u0026rsquo;erhalang predlagal kompromisni načrt, v katerem je sprejel Huang Taijijevega sina Fulina, da bi nasledil prestol, dokler Fulin ne odraste in prevzame vlado, skupaj z Dorgonom pa pomagata vladi. Tako bi Jierhalang, ki je bil zvest Huang taiji, lahko zagotovil, da Dorgonova skupina ne bi maščevala Haugeja in drugih, Dorgonovim ljudem pa ne bi bilo treba skrbeti, da bodo likvidirani.\nVse strani so predlog sprejele. Rojstna mati malega Fulina, Zhuang Fei, se je tako lahko kot cesarica vdova pridružila Huang taijijevima dvema palačama, cesarici Srednjega kraljestva. Kasneje, z vojsko Qing, Dorgonovo nenadno smrtjo, vladavino Kangxi in vrsto dogodkov, je status cesarice vdove Xiao Zhuang postal višji in višji in sčasoma je dobil \u0026ldquo;združeni dve dinastiji sinovske pobožnosti, skrajne tri generacije spoštovanja sorodnikov\u0026rdquo; vzvišenega statusa.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/13.huangtaijibushenchongaidexiaozhuangshiruhedengshangdianfengdesl/","summary":"V zgodovini dinastije Qing sta nam najbolj znani dve močni ženski.

Kako se je Xiaozhuang, ki mu Huang taiji ni bil preveč naklonjen, povzpel "},{"content":"Faced with all the discontents in his life, Gao Shi, at the age of 52, chose to resign and go to Chang\u0026rsquo;an to become a \u0026ldquo;Beijing drifter\u0026rdquo; again.\nIt took courage to make such a decision. In ancient China, it was not uncommon for people like Tao Yuanming to resign from their posts and return to their fields because they were unhappy with their jobs, but it was rare for people like Gao Shi to resign because he was dissatisfied with his job and rejoin the capital to find a job when he was over half a century old. Gao Shi\u0026rsquo;s boldness is evident.\nIn Chang\u0026rsquo;an, Gao Shi met many old friends and made many new ones. Among Gao Shi\u0026rsquo;s old friends, the most famous one is Du Fu. In 744 A.D., Li Bai and Du Fu came to Songzhou, Gao Shi\u0026rsquo;s hometown, and Gao Shi accompanied them on their travels, leaving a good story in the history of literature. When Gao Shi came to Chang\u0026rsquo;an again, he met with Du Fu quite frequently. At the same time, Gao Shi also made many new friends, such as Zhang Xu, who was known as the \u0026ldquo;Saint of Cursive\u0026rdquo;, and Gao Shi wrote a poem to praise him, \u0026ldquo;The world is full of acquaintances, but this man is different. He was a sage in calligraphy, and he was a great loudspeaker when he was drunk. The old man with white hair has no time to spare, but the green clouds are now. A pot of wine at his bedside, how many times he can sleep\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;After getting drunk, he gave a gift to Zhang Juxu\u0026rdquo;). In addition, Gao Shi also attended many banquets held by court officials with the introduction of his friends, which enabled him to expand his network.\nIn Chang\u0026rsquo;an, although Gao Shi met his friends, he did not find a suitable job. So Gao Shi left Chang\u0026rsquo;an again and traveled west. When he arrived at the right side of the river, Gao Shi met Goshu Han, who was then the governor of the west side of the river. After some conversation, Gao Shi Han appreciated this man with frosty temples and asked him to be the secretary of his army. \u0026ldquo;The full name of this official position is \u0026ldquo;Jidu Jidu\u0026rdquo;, which is an official in charge of important documents, pilgrimages, rituals, prayers, and orders under the command of the Jidu. Although the rank of this official position was not high, it was one of the most intimate officials of the festival, which was obviously important for Gao Shi, who was already over 50 years old. Gao Shi, who had been wandering for a long time, finally found a job again.\nHere, it is necessary to introduce Goshu Han again - he would be an indispensable role in Gao Shi\u0026rsquo;s future life. Goshu Han, originally from the Goshu tribe, the head of the Western Turkic Turks, was the deputy governor of the Anxi Prefecture and ambassador of the Chishui Army (now Wuwei in Gansu), while his mother, Yuchi, was the princess of the King of Ü-Tep, a wealthy family. However, since childhood, Goshu Han was fond of drinking and gambling and did not do anything significant. It was not until he was 40 years old that Goshu Han decided to join the army to kill the enemy and came to join the army under the tent of Wang Zhan, the governor of Hexi. He came to the army in 742 A.D., but five years later in 747 A.D. he was promoted by Emperor Xuanzong to the position of Longye Festival Minister. Such a speedy promotion was inevitable.\nGoshu Han was known for his bravery in battle, and the song \u0026ldquo;Goshu Song\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;The seven stars of the Big Dipper are high, Goshu carries his sword at night. To this day, he does not dare to cross Lintao.\u0026rdquo;) is the praise of Goshu Han\u0026rsquo;s war performance. However, after Goshu Han became the Longye Festival Minister, his reputation among the people and scholars plummeted, and it all started from the battle of Shibao Castle, which he commanded.\nShibao Castle was a military fortress built by the Tubo army in today\u0026rsquo;s Qinghai province. During the reign of Tianbao, Emperor Xuanzong, who valued the achievements of the border, ordered Goshuhan\u0026rsquo;s superior, Wang Zhongsi, who was then the envoy of the Hexi and Longye Festival, to attack Shibao Castle. As a famous general of his generation, Wang Zhongsi refused to carry out the order because he thought that the fortress was extremely strong and it would cost him a lot of death and injury if he attacked it by force. This incident offended Emperor Xuanzong, who then asked Goshu Han to replace Wang Zhongsi as the Longye Festival Minister. After that, Emperor Xuanzong mobilized tens of thousands of soldiers from Shuofang and Hedong under the command of Goshu Han and ordered him to attack Shibao Castle. At this time, Goshu Han dared not disobey Emperor Xuanzong\u0026rsquo;s will again and forced the soldiers to attack the city. In the end, Wang Zhongshi\u0026rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled, and the Tang army took the city after tens of thousands of casualties, capturing only four hundred Tubo soldiers. Xuanzong was so pleased with the victory that he not only promoted Goshu Han, but also gave his son a fifth-ranking official. For a while, Goshu Han was in a great position.\nAlthough Emperor Xuanzong valued Goshu Han, he could not stop people from talking about him. Many scholars at that time and many later scholars never had a contemptuous attitude toward Goshu Han\u0026rsquo;s war service. For example, Li Bai wrote, \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t learn from Goshu, you can\u0026rsquo;t walk across the Qinghai Sea at night with a sword, and take the purple robe from the Western slaughter of the Stone Fort\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Answer to Wang XII\u0026rsquo;s cold night drinking alone\u0026rdquo;), and Chao said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have the name of Mao Gong Turk, but I am the Great Wall for my country. I am not a general of the Stone Fort, but I took the purple robe with a sword\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Repeatedly using the previous rhyme to present a poem to Lu Zhi Tang Gong Cheng Ji Mingliu\u0026rdquo;); Su Shi wrote \u0026ldquo;The old general of Shuofang is still in the wind, but he did not take the stone fortress city of Xifan\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Read the \u0026ldquo;Legacy of Kaiyuan Tianbao\u0026rdquo;); Xue Dasun wrote \u0026ldquo;The monarch has paid for the Juyan plug, but the old general would rather covet the stone fortress city\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Winging History - its three\u0026rdquo;) \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; and in Among these poems, the most famous one is Du Fu\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The line of the military chariot\u0026rdquo;[1] with the line \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t see the head of the Qinghai Sea, the white bones of the ancient times are not collected. The new ghosts are bothered by the old ghosts crying, and the sky is cloudy and wet with the sound of chirping.\u0026rdquo; One can\u0026rsquo;t help but cover up the volume and sigh.\nOf course, these folk poems did not have any substantial impact on Goshuhan. With his victory in the battle of Shibao Castle, Goshu Han was highly favored by Emperor Xuanzong. It was at this time that Gao Shi came into the sight of Goshu Han. It was impossible for Gao Shi not to know what kind of position Goshu Han had in the court at that time. For Gao Shi, who wanted to build a successful career, there was no reason for him to refuse the invitation from Goshu Han. In this way, Gao Shi entered the army of Goshu Han and became the secretary under his command.\nI think Gao Shi was not at peace with himself when he came to Goshu Han\u0026rsquo;s army. In a hundred years ago, his grandfather Gao Jingyi had been the long right road marching general, became a generation of famous generals, a hundred years later when he came to the long right, more than half a hundred years old but only an ordinary staff, they can still afford to ancestral achievements? Gao Shi may have repeatedly asked himself.\nGao Shi\u0026rsquo;s choice, and not all of his friends to understand. At least, Du Fu, who wrote \u0026ldquo;The Line of the Bing Chariot\u0026rdquo;, felt that Gao Shi should not strive for success under someone like Goshu Han. Once, when Gao Shi followed Goshu Han to victory in battle, Du Fu wanted Gao Shi to ask Goshu Han why he had to fight in places where birds don\u0026rsquo;t shit (\u0026ldquo;Please ask the general: How can we use the poor wilderness for. (Fifteen Rhymes for Sending Gao 35 Secretaries). Du Fu even compares Gao Shi to a \u0026ldquo;hungry eagle\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;A hungry eagle, not yet full of meat, flies on its wings with others\u0026rdquo; - this is almost like accusing Gao Shi of being Goshuhan\u0026rsquo;s hawk and dog. However, Gao Shi\u0026rsquo;s reply to Du Fu was \u0026ldquo;A reply to a clerk of the clouds, who is ashamed to be known as a national scholar\u0026rdquo;. No matter what the image of Goshu Han was among the people, at least to Gao Shi, Goshu Han gave him the courtesy of a \u0026ldquo;national scholar\u0026rdquo;, and such a kindness was something Gao Shi wanted to repay. In fact, Du Fu also saw how much Goshu Han valued Gao Shi, so he said that Gao Shi would be able to lead the army on his own in about ten years (\u0026ldquo;After ten years out of the shogunate, he can hold the army command.\u0026rdquo;). (Fifteen Rhymes for Gao\u0026rsquo;s Thirty-Five Clerks). In any case, for Gao Shi, who was more than half a century old, this was probably the last chance in his life, and he had to seize it no matter what.\nOf course, what neither Gao Shi nor Du Fu expected was that it would not take ten years to take charge of the \u0026ldquo;military command\u0026rdquo; - after only three years, Gao Shi became a knight-errant with a heavy military force.\nReference ^ Regarding the background of Du Fu\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Chariot Line\u0026rdquo;, it is said to be a satire on the use of troops in Qinghai by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, while the other one is a satire on the use of troops in Yunnan by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/52suidelaojingpiaozongsuangenduilehaolingdao/","summary":"Faced with all the discontents in his life, Gao Shi, at the age of 52, chose to resign and go to Chang\u0026rsquo;an to become a \u0026ldquo;Beijing drifter\u0026rdquo; again.\nIt took courage to make such a decision. In ancient China, it was not uncommon for people like Tao Yuanming to resign from their posts and return to their fields because they were unhappy with their jobs, but it was rare for people like Gao Shi to resign because he was dissatisfied with his job and rejoin the capital to find a job when he was over half a century old.","title":"4.52-year-old Beijing drifters, finally with the right leader"},{"content":"The promotion path of people in the workplace is usually like this: employee \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; middle management \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; executive \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; VP level \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor.\nThe cognitive ability of investors is considered the top level, because investors need to have enough ability to predict the industry trends and know the future direction, so as to discover companies with potential (high probability of success) for investment.\nEach layer of cognitive ability is different, and the higher the level of cognitive ability, the stronger. Some people can jump up, while others are still stuck at a certain stage and find it difficult to move up. So what level are you at? Have you ever thought about how to change the status quo?\nHere are a few typical elements of cognitive upgrading (only a brief introduction, and not extended. In-depth thinking about these elements is covered in other articles in the cognitive series).\nCritique of self Upgrade from \u0026ldquo;I know I\u0026rsquo;m right\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;How do I know I\u0026rsquo;m right\u0026rdquo;.\nThese are two ways of thinking.\n\u0026ldquo;I know I\u0026rsquo;m right\u0026rdquo; is the subconscious response of most people, who decide that they are right at the subjective level of consciousness when making decisions, stemming from the ego\u0026rsquo;s unconditional trust in itself.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know I am right\u0026rdquo; is a typical expression of critical thinking. After the subjective consciousness makes a judgment, it does not rush to a conclusion first, but doubts the conclusion, must I be right, how did I determine that I am right. In the process of judging, what is the basis of my judgment, is my source of information accurate, and are there any omissions.\nThe former is \u0026lsquo;fast thinking\u0026rsquo; and the latter is \u0026lsquo;slow thinking\u0026rsquo;. Fast thinking is an ability evolved by humans in the evolutionary process to adapt to survival, manifested as seeing the wind blowing and grass to run, there may be a tiger hidden inside, in ancient times, those who did not run were eaten by wild animals. Others and their views do not agree, will subconsciously refute.\nOffended by someone, will immediately angry, into a state of battle. It\u0026rsquo;s like Homo sapiens in the tribal era, when Homo sapiens from another tribe entered your territory and posed a threat to you.\nThinking fast was very useful when humans did not have basic security issues addressed. But in modern society, human survival and security problems have also been basically solved, and there are no wild animals on the street or in the office. So this kind of fast thinking will be overwhelmed and unable to adapt in the face of complex problems.\nSlow thinking is more useful in the modern fast-paced information age, asking more questions about why, rather than making immediate decisions based on intuition. Intuition can be right or wrong. By thinking about things from a different perspective, you can come to more reliable conclusions. As I gradually allowed myself not to rely on my intuition, I found that many things were not as simple as they appeared and that I was able to control my emotions.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t think of the solution as the problem itself. This phrase means that once you encounter a problem, don\u0026rsquo;t immediately look for a solution. Rather, first think, the problem is not the surface of the problem, whether there is a deeper problem. If a startup company is developing a new product and needs to hurry up and finish the development, but you find that your employees start to leave work on time and stop working hard, you may think that the problem is with the employees, if you think carefully about why the employees will leave work on time instead of trying to do a better job and create more value by working overtime in the company. It could be that the employee has something going on at home, or it could be that the employee doesn\u0026rsquo;t really understand why the company is rushing. Or it could be something else.\nThink outside the box Understand the limitations of human thinking caused by the evolution of the brain not keeping up with the technological explosion during the evolutionary process.\nNumerous facts show that the environment is changing so fast that natural selection (the evolution of the brain) has not kept pace.\nThe modern human brain evolved successfully 200,000 years ago.\nHowever, our brain capacity stopped growing 200,000 years ago. So, why didn\u0026rsquo;t the human brain get bigger? This may be because an increase in brain volume increases the risk of newborns at birth. In addition, our brain is a major energy consumer, consuming nearly 20% of our body\u0026rsquo;s energy, and if we increase its size, humans may not be able to meet the energy demands of the brain.\nThe science fiction novel \u0026ldquo;Three Bodies\u0026rdquo; refers to the \u0026ldquo;technological explosion\u0026rdquo;. Humanity entered the industrial revolution three hundred years ago, the information revolution (the fourth industrial revolution) a few decades ago, and in recent years to the era of artificial intelligence, on the scale of 200,000 years, whether hundreds of years or decades, if calculated proportionally, not even a moment, so there is a technology explosion of this statement.\nAs mentioned earlier, \u0026ldquo;fast thinking\u0026rdquo; is an evolutionary limitation of thinking.\nCognitive scientists Messier and Sperber wrote: \u0026ldquo;Rationality is an adaptive trait that humans evolved to help individuals be able to adapt to life in highly social groups.\nHumans did not evolve rationality to solve abstract, logical problems or to help us draw conclusions from messy data, but to solve a range of problems encountered in group collaboration. If the early groups of humans to work together were a group of irrational people exist, then the fate of the group would eventually inevitably implode and disband. Imagine a scenario where everyone thinks he or she is the smartest one and is very emotional, thinking that everyone else is retarded, then when the group gets together to discuss things, it basically starts with a fight and ends with a group fight.\nIf rationality were to solve abstract problems, logical problems, then the human brain would not have so many cognitive biases (intuitions and biases), such as the \u0026ldquo;halo effect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;anchoring effect\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;survivor bias\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nCritical thinking The ability to think independently and not follow the crowd.\nThe first thing is to question.\nWhether the other side has an interest in the viewpoint, and what kind of starting point and purpose they have in thinking that way.\nHow much truth there is in a news report, and what possible truths may be hidden behind it.\nIn what time and context did the author of the book come to such conclusions.\nIs the information we have one side of the story.\nDo I agree with the other side because the other side shares my views.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThe next step is to gather information.\nWhat information is available on the other side of the conflict of interest with the other side.\nWhat other people who have a different point of view than the author have to say\nWhat are the stakeholders, what are their relationships like, and how do they trade with each other.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThen synthesize the analysis.\nWhich party has the most to gain from the whole event.\nHow does this matter affect me.\nHow do I need to respond.\nThis completes a process of independent thinking.\nKnow what you want Know the gap between fact and desire and the path of how to achieve the desire (goal).\nWhat is your goal.\nIn five years, what do you want yourself to be?\nWill you be smarter?\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nPrinciples to keep in mind in achieving your goals.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t focus on excelling, but rather on growing and improving\nA sense of accomplishment is the first self-driving force\nBe clear about the principles of goal setting\nBe clear about the possible reasons for not achieving your goals\nKnow the difference between the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; way of thinking\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.\nThe \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; are actually the difference between concrete and abstract ways of thinking.\nSay you have to do something: work 2 hours at night.\nA concrete mindset would think like this (what): you have to work 2 hours at night to finish a 3000-word document.\nThe abstract mindset would think something like this (why): What I\u0026rsquo;m going to do tonight will improve my writing.\nThe abstract way of thinking is the cause of the behavior, and the concrete way of thinking is the manifestation of the behavior. In contrast, the abstract way of thinking is more capable of giving motivation.\nMastering Methodology Have a methodology that works for you to make decisions.\nWhat is methodology. Methodology is the theory about the way people understand the world and transform the world. While worldview mainly solves the problem of \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; the world is, methodology mainly solves the problem of \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo;. Methodology is a theoretical system or system aimed at solving problems, usually involving the discussion of problem stages, tasks, tools, and methodological techniques.\nA brief introduction to a methodology.\nWSR methodology - proposed in 1994 at HULL University in the UK by Chinese systems science experts Prof. Kifa Gu and Dr. Zhichang Zhu - is very foreign and consists of the initials of three words: physical (W), matter (S), and human (R). In simple terms, it means: what, how, and who.\n\u0026ldquo;Physics\u0026rdquo; refers to the mechanism involving the movement of matter, which includes both physics in a narrow sense, but also chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy and so on. It is usually necessary to use natural science knowledge to answer mainly what \u0026ldquo;matter\u0026rdquo; is, such as the law of gravity describing free fall, the genetic code carried by the double helix in DNA, and the principle of nuclear power plants to convert the huge energy produced by nuclear reactions into electricity. Physics requires realism, the study of objective reality. The knowledge imparted by university science and engineering schools is mainly used to solve various \u0026ldquo;physical\u0026rdquo; problems.\n\u0026ldquo;Theory\u0026rdquo; refers to the rationale for doing things, mainly addressing how to arrange all the equipment, materials, and personnel. Knowledge of operations research and management science is often used to answer the question of \u0026ldquo;how to do it\u0026rdquo;. Typical examples are the Apollo program, the construction of nuclear power plants, and the design and management of supply chains.\n\u0026ldquo;Humanism\u0026rdquo; refers to the rationale of being a human being, which usually requires knowledge of humanities and social sciences to answer the questions of \u0026ldquo;what should be done\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;how best to do it\u0026rdquo;. In real life, no matter what \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; are done without human beings, and it is also up to human beings to judge whether these things and things are properly applied, so system practice must fully consider the human factor.\nPictures We can learn from these methodologies rather than accepting them wholesale. The more generic a methodology is, the more abstract it indicates, and the more difficult it is to practice it. So it\u0026rsquo;s important to learn from them and make trade-offs with your personal situation. To translate the WSR methodology, we can understand \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;tools\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;human nature\u0026rdquo;.\nWith a slight transformation, a formula is derived.\nMethodology = knowledge base + thinking tools + benefit distribution.\nIf you want to cook for a few friends at home (to solve a problem), then you first need to go shopping for food (knowledge base), if a dish is not made before, then maybe you need to go online to find recipes to see how to cook (thinking tools), and discuss the division of labor among friends (benefit distribution) - who washes, cuts, stirs, and washing dishes.\nHave the ability to discover the nature of things Understanding the cause and effect relationships behind the laws of real things and dealing with reality.\nThere are scientists on the blue planet; Newton discovered gravity, Einstein published the theory of relativity, and Darwin published the doctrine of evolutionary natural selection. These are all great things that happened in the field of science. Scientists have been exploring the nature of their field of expertise.\nThere are 13 constants in our universe, so to speak, and the properties and behavior of our universe can be deduced from these numbers, and changing the value of any one of them would not constitute our present universe. These 13 constants include: the universal gravitational constant, the speed of light, absolute zero, Hubble\u0026rsquo;s constant, Planck\u0026rsquo;s constant, etc. The cosmological numbers are those constants that are related to the physical laws of the universe. Not all numbers related to the natural world are cosmic numbers. The number 10, which is the basis of the modern decimal system, is a human invention, chosen because it is the number of fingers of our hands.\nEven a well-known cosmic physicist has suggested that the nature of the fourth universe is a mathematical structure. We are not going to explore here whether these theories about the nature of the universe are plausible or not, but we are talking about an issue that is very relevant to us.\nOrdinary people do not have the ability or the need to explore scientific truth, but there are still many questions in the world that we should think about, such as the nature of business, the nature of industry, the nature of something.\nFor example.\nThe nature of business model: the transaction structure of stakeholders\nThe essence of photography: the photographer uses the lens to capture an emotional moment and deliver it to the audience\nThe essence of Internet products: to help users save time or to help them pass the time\nThe essence of fiction: build a virtual world with words to tell a story and immerse the reader in it\nThe essence of finance: transfer of value across time.\nThe essence of the Chinese people\u0026rsquo;s liberation cause: class struggle\nThe essence of Tencent: connecting everything\nThe essence of Ali: online commercial real estate\nThe essence of search engines: Passive advertising\nThe essence of today\u0026rsquo;s headlines: trainable active advertising\nThe essence of social e-commerce: the trust of consuming social relationships\nThinking about the essence of a thing allows us to quickly grasp the point, and also to see through the various disguises above the essence at a glance.\nSeeing the world from an evolutionary perspective Whether anything and behavior is valuable, the scale of value is relative to survival.\nThe main components of Darwin\u0026rsquo;s evolutionary doctrine of natural selection are: overpopulation, struggle for survival (also called competition for survival), heredity and variation, and survival of the fittest.\nDarwin\u0026rsquo;s doctrine of evolutionary natural selection emphasizes not evolution, but adaptation. Only organisms that adapt to changes in their surroundings will survive.\nIf you choose a goal, then everything should be judged around that goal to see if it is worthwhile.\nOur anxiety comes from not knowing where to start, there are many things to do and each one is important. But we all forget what our original purpose was. We have a direction, but in the process, we throw it aside. It\u0026rsquo;s as if direction and goals are left behind the moment we set them down.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say our goal is to move from senior manager to director in three years. But there are many things in life and in the process that we would like to do.\nLearn the methodology of Raising Cognitive Ability and practice it\nRead regularly to ensure the knowledge base\nMany courses on knowledge payment, \u0026ldquo;Economics Course at Peking University\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Wu Jun Methodology\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Classical Music from Amateur to Appreciation\u0026rdquo; all feel quite good and want to learn but have limited time.\nRecently released some blockbuster movies, I also want to go to see them, otherwise I will be out of touch with the people around me.\nMy friend quit her job and is going on a trip to Turkey and Paris, and I want to see the world too.\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nEverything looks valuable, and because of that, we become hard to choose and thus become anxious because we don\u0026rsquo;t have a standard to judge the value of a thing. This criterion is our goal, our desire.\nGoing back to the goal, since you want a promotion in your position, you should choose the first two. If your goal is to travel the world and entertain yourself, then choose the last two.\nIn business, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they are profitable for the business.\nIn life, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they contribute to the accomplishment of our personal goals.\nAchieve cognitive iteration Knowledge base and continuous learning.\nWe all know that the performance of a computer is determined by hardware (CPU, motherboard, memory, etc.) and operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and application software. If the hardware and operating system are consistent, the performance of the computer is determined by the application software.\nThe software and apps that run on the operating system, we call them programs. According to computer scientist von Neumann, program = data + algorithm. In fact operating system is also a specific program.\nIf we compare a person to a computer, then the human brain is the equivalent of the computer\u0026rsquo;s hardware, and the cognitive ability is the equivalent of the computer\u0026rsquo;s program. Cognitive ability (program) = learning method + knowledge base (data) + thinking style (algorithm).\nWhether it is continuous learning or lifelong learning, the purpose is the same effect as keeping the operating system and program updated and upgraded, so that the processing power of the human brain can be continuously improved.\nPictures Summary Generally speaking, people may have only certain elements, and in some elements a certain level. These elements interact with each other, and the process of cognitive upgrading is the upgrading of the proficiency level of mastery and use of the elements.\nThere is not a clear standard to state what tier has what criteria, it is recommended to start with a certain element to think deeply, practice and master.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/8geyaodianzhunishixianrenzhidiedai/","summary":"The promotion path of people in the workplace is usually like this: employee \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; middle management \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; executive \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; VP level \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; entrepreneurial success CEO \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; investor.\nThe cognitive ability of investors is considered the top level, because investors need to have enough ability to predict the industry trends and know the future direction, so as to discover companies with potential (high probability of success) for investment.","title":"3.8 points to help you achieve cognitive iteration"},{"content":"Before starting this book, let me start with a real experience of a user who consulted me, which I have annotated in red\nFemale, 22 years old, super sensitive Comment 1: A 22 year old girl, why is her skin super sensitive?

I would like to ask Uncle Mo, what are the safe anti-aging products? As I mentioned in my previous article, since life has entered sexual reproduction, the laws of nature seem to favor the DNA carried in the cells of living beings to be immortalized through the generations, and living beings become a shell, and the meaning of a short life seems to be to pass the DNA, the key object of protection, to the next generation.\nLife Train\nI watched a Japanese anime that described life in this way:\n\u0026ldquo;From the moment the train starts (your birth), there will be different people getting on and getting off.\n\u0026ldquo;Some of these people will be on the train for a short time, and some will be on the train for a long time, and they are the people who will cross paths with you in your life.\n\u0026ldquo;Eventually, the train comes to an end and stops (at the end of life).\u0026rdquo;\nMy heart was heavy at that time after reading it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until many years later that I understood the laws of nature and was relieved.\nProgrammed aging\nSince we were born, our body seems to be going through a programmed aging process, let\u0026rsquo;s review:\nEmbryo (fertilization ~ 8 weeks after fertilization) The sperm and egg meet and begin to form a fertilized egg.\nFetus (10th week of pregnancy to birth) Various organs begin to be formed and perfected.\nInfant (0~12 months) During the breastfeeding period, milk teeth begin to form.\n4)Infant (1~3 years old)\nLearning to walk.\nChildhood / Adolescence (4~11 years old) Teeth are replaced.\nAdolescence (12~19 years old) Rapid growth in height and weight, male and female maturity.\nAdulthood (20~60 years old) Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 49 and 52, and women lose their fertility;\nAt the age of 50, hair starts to turn gray.\n8)Old age (61 years old and above)\nNearly half of all people over the age of 75 have hearing loss;\nOver age 80, nearly half of Americans have cataracts.\nFrom top to bottom, this is the stage we all go through, like a fixed coding program, since the formation of a fertilized egg, it has been imprinted in our cells, carrying out the programmed aging.\nHave you ever marveled? What are the forces that control our growth, development and aging so precisely?\nThe basic units that make up our cells are all inanimate chemical molecules. It\u0026rsquo;s fascinating to me that these simple or complex chemical molecules act like a machine that precisely controls our body\u0026rsquo;s programmed growth and aging process at different time periods!\nThe biological clock of aging\nIn every living organism, there seems to be such a precise biological clock of aging.\nFor example:\nThe growth of milk teeth begins between 6 and 8 months of age;\nPuberty begins at the age of 12 to 13 years;\nMenopause occurs at the age of 49-52;\nHair graying occurs at about 50 years of age;\n\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nWe still don\u0026rsquo;t know the mechanism of how all this happens? This is the reason why it is repeatedly emphasized and described:\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know why the human body ages? If we don\u0026rsquo;t even know the mechanism of aging, how can we talk about anti-aging? How is it possible to achieve?\nWith the progress of life science research, some explanations for the aging mechanism have emerged, such as DNA damage.\nDNA damage\nOne study showed that dogs can lose about 3.3% of their cardiac myocyte DNA per year, while humans lose about 0.6% of their myocardial DNA per year.\nTherefore, some scientists believe that genetic damage to DNA may be the central cause of aging in humans.\nDNA is a long, double-stranded spiral, and the genes that determine our body\u0026rsquo;s hair and skin are small segments of that long chain.\nIf you think of DNA as a long chain, then genes are like a section of the chain. There are about 20,000 to 30,000 genes in our human DNA, which is only 1.5% of the length of the DNA chain.\nAccording to the theory of DNA damage, we lose about 0.6% of our DNA every year during the continuous cell replication and division, and this accumulated damage leads to our aging step by step.\nOf course, this is only one of the speculations on the mechanism of human aging, according to the current level of technology, we can not stop the DNA damage, and we can not really fight against aging.\nThere are other speculations about aging, such as DNA methylation, telomere theory, waste accumulation, free radical theory, and so on. One of the speculations about free radicals involves antioxidants, which we have mentioned in previous chapters.\nAnti-aging drugs\nA number of anti-aging supplements, skin care products, and pharmaceuticals have appeared on the market.\nOf these 3 products, drugs are more credible because they must be supported by experimental data and human clinical data to be marketed. Health supplements and skin care products, on the other hand, are all \u0026ldquo;talk\u0026rdquo; products with no credible data to support their effectiveness.\nSome studies have shown that calorie-restricted diets can extend the life span of some animals. Some calorie-restricted analog drugs, such as rapamycin and metformin, are also being studied. However, no human clinical data have been reported.\nThat is to say, there are no potent drugs that can understandably fight aging. After all, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what causes our bodies to age until now.\nFor those products that claim to be anti-aging when applied to the skin or taken orally, just listen to them and don\u0026rsquo;t take them seriously.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/25suihouyaoyongkanglaochanpinma/","summary":"Should I use anti-aging products after the age of 25? \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been told to prevent aging in advance, but do I really need to use anti-aging skin care products after 25?

At that time, I was still in junior high school, and every night at dinner time, the TV would play a domestic criminal investigation drama, the specific name of the drama now can not remember, only remember that there are a lot of such as \u0026ldquo;extract evidence back to the laboratory to check\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;decent scientific analysis\u0026rdquo; and such unexplained scenes, the main object of examination is the bones, fingerprints, blood, etc., at that time, I felt that this work is really high-end. At that time, the Internet was not yet convenient, and without knowing more about the situation, I set myself the ideal of \u0026ldquo;to be such a forensic scientist\u0026rdquo;. Now I look back and think, this is not forensics! It was a hodgepodge of various branches of forensic science and trace inspection work, and in some places it was seriously out of touch with reality.\nWhen the college entrance examination, originally because of their own interest in mathematics, physics is pathetic, for biology, medical aspects is very much like, think to study medicine it. However, I was already very uncomfortable with the bad doctor-patient relationship, and I was tired of thinking about it. Although I remembered my dream of forensic medicine, I also thought that \u0026ldquo;forensic medicine is just contacting dead people\u0026rdquo;, and finally entered the pure engineering major of electrical information through various misunderstandings.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the first week of college, and the high math and physics could kill me a hundred times. I remembered my \u0026ldquo;forensic dream\u0026rdquo; again. Through communication with teachers and seniors, interviews, and attending professional courses, I firmly decided that I must study forensics. Luckily, the school had a policy of transferring majors, and I successfully transferred to the forensic science program.\nAfter so many years of personal experience in forensic science, I realized that there are so many things that people do not understand about this profession when they often ask me with hesitation or confusion. Out of my love for forensics, I started to popularize forensics on the Internet, hoping that more people would understand the real forensics, so that some unscientific and incorrect perceptions could be deciphered and this mysterious profession could be presented more realistically in front of everyone. This is also in order to leave a little trace, to those who also have a dream like me back then, but no way to understand the children some modest help.\nBecause of my work, I always try to avoid touching cases in my writing, and I always try to use simple and straightforward life language to explain the professional content. I have to admit that it is easy to feel boring, and even if the cute and amusing style of writing is interesting, it can only be used as a spice occasionally, but it will become boring after reading too much.\nTherefore, this time I received an invitation to write an e-book, and after careful consideration, I intend to show the practical application of forensic knowledge through some specific cases: I say \u0026ldquo;cases\u0026rdquo;, but in fact it is just a short story. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;art comes from life and is higher than life\u0026rdquo;, my poor writing is not much of an art, but the truth is the same, that is.\nThe storyline involved in this article is presented through artificial processing and fiction, in which the time, names of people, places, and details are fictitious.

I\u0026rsquo;m not going to work tomorrow, so I can be as lazy as I want! Listening to the rhythm of the music on my phone, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but hum along. The interesting Sichuan lyrics make me feel close to Chengdu after living there for many years, and more importantly, this song simply sings out my heart now!\nToday is the first day of the National Day holiday, although last night a hundred miles out of a super far site in the middle of the night, almost a sleepless night, rushed back to the autopsy to finish at 7:00 am, but think about a few shifts for colleagues before, and then this holiday will not have to be on duty, can go to a good sleep, a good rest, do not have to guard the phone to be summoned feeling, but still makes me happy.\n\u0026ldquo;~~~~~\u0026rdquo;\nThe cell phone of Dr. Sun, who had just finished the autopsy together, rang. He lit up the screen to me, and when I saw the word \u0026ldquo;director\u0026rdquo;, I hurriedly paused the music, but I was still immersed in the feeling of \u0026ldquo;awesome\u0026rdquo; happiness.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s me. We just finished the autopsy at midnight last night. Yes! The wife killed her husband and then burned the body. No problem! The head wound was fatal. A titty hammer-like tool was used. Hmm! Okay, okay! All sorts of things were mentioned, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry Chief!\u0026rdquo; I listened to Dr. Sun\u0026rsquo;s answer and knew it was the director who was asking about last night\u0026rsquo;s case. The autopsy was not difficult, and the case would be solved when the source of the body was found.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah? What? Another scene? Yeah! I know, we\u0026rsquo;re on our way!\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun\u0026rsquo;s next answer was a cold shower on my head! I looked at Dr. Sun with disbelief.\nI looked at Dr. Sun with disbelief. I saw Dr. Sun put down the phone with a grave look on his face, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquo;Your Flag is down again!\nAfter looking at Dr. Sun carefully, I said with a disdainful face, \u0026ldquo;Humph! You just know how to tease me! Just now when you finally said there was a scene, there was no sound in the phone. And! Look at your eyebrows are flying up to the sky, if you want to laugh, laugh out, don\u0026rsquo;t hold in a face of folds!\n\u0026ldquo;Ah ha ha ha, I can\u0026rsquo;t hide it from you! Dr. Sun laughed out happily.\n\u0026ldquo;No sooner had Dr. Sun\u0026rsquo;s words left his mouth than his cell phone rang again. He raised his hand and found that it was the director calling again.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the director?\u0026rdquo; Forensic scientist Sun picked up the phone, \u0026ldquo;Huh? Oh! Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s read the notice sheet first, then we\u0026rsquo;ll leave right away, see you at the scene!\nThe forensic scientist hung up the phone and turned his head to look at me, and a face worse than tears appeared before my eyes: \u0026ldquo;This time there is a real scene.\nThis was like a bolt from the blue! Because the daily shift is 8:30 am, now even 8:00 am has not yet arrived, the case at this time is still considered me and Dr. Sun forensic.\nUnhappy is unhappy, but the work must be done. Besides, \u0026ldquo;young people, it is necessary to work more to gain more knowledge! I sometimes admire my ability to comfort myself.\nAfter driving an hour to the scene with Dr. Sun, I parked the car and went to the trunk to take out a survey box. The last scene on my body survey undershirt \u0026ldquo;strategic reserve\u0026rdquo; is almost depleted, can only carry this dead weight of the box.\nThe scene in a small highway next to the green belt, the small road looks like just recently repaired, the roadside saplings are just planted in. The scene has been pulled a good cordon, but in order not to affect the highway traffic, pull the scope of a little small, plus some onlookers blocked in front of the eyes, simply can not see what kind of inside.\nI looked down through the barrier, the first thing I saw was a white SUV car with a male body lying on the side. The director and forensic scientist Sun were pointing at the body and the car and saying something, so I lifted my foot and walked towards them.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey! Watch your step!!!\u0026rdquo; Just as I reached the sapling, I heard someone yell out to me.\nI looked down and realized that I had just been so focused on the corpse that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even noticed the puddle of headlight debris in the direction I was going.\nI smiled shyly at my colleague who had warned me and walked around the debris.\nThere were two obvious rut marks in the grass by the roadside saplings, the grass in the rut marks had fallen over, and a physical evidence plate was placed next to a small tree, which marked out a small puddle of blood. Along the rut marks forward is a small piece of sand, the car and the body are placed on this small piece of sand, the ground footprints, tire tread marks are particularly messy. The front end of the car rushed to a bush that had been skewed, and the bush appeared again next to the rutted tracks, this time extending all the way to the fence.\nWhat struck me as odd was that the director and Dr. Sun were not looking at the body, but rather at the wheels of the SUV - more specifically, a fender above the left rear wheel.\n\u0026ldquo;You see a bloodstain here, obviously in a directional wipe shape.\u0026rdquo; The director said to Dr. Sun while gesturing in the direction, \u0026ldquo;And this direction is from the back to the front.\n\u0026ldquo;Director, the study of bloodstains, more should be the trace investigation they do, right? I asked the director in confusion, \u0026ldquo;How did you start studying this?\n\u0026ldquo;The director said, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about this over the years, so let\u0026rsquo;s use it when we have the chance. The director said to me.\nThe director said to me, \u0026ldquo;There is no rule that forensic pathologists can\u0026rsquo;t do this. And, this case is all about these details. Because there are two people who say they drove the car and killed someone.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen a person compete to be a suspect.\u0026rdquo; I put down the case and started to prepare their equipment and tools.\n\u0026ldquo;The two suspects, plus the victim, are a family of three, a father and two sons, the younger son died, and now his father and his elder brother both say they were driving.\nThe director introduced the situation to me and Dr. Sun forensics.\n\u0026ldquo;This family got a lot of compensation because of the demolition, the car is when the father bought a new, money and house or something also have a lot. The brothers had a lot of conflicts because of this property distribution, the father not only did not stop, but also joined in the quarrel together. Last night, the three of them argued all night long. At 4:00 am, the youngest son took advantage of the other two\u0026rsquo;s inattention and ran out with the property certificate. After that, the two men\u0026rsquo;s stories differed.\n\u0026ldquo;The older son said he found out his brother ran away first and came out to chase him in his car, and after he caught up with him, he told his brother not to leave first and to get in the car for discussion. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect my brother to listen, so he became angry and tried to speed up to stop him. I did not expect to hit my brother, after knocking him down a thrill, directly into the bushes, backing out of the car felt the rear wheels pressed into something, after parking found his brother crushed under the wheels, and rushed to get into the car moved down. After more than an hour, Dad came after him and saw that it had been so.\n\u0026ldquo;The father said that he found it first, drove out to catch up, after catching up, drove after him, followed all the way to the noise, and then the father wanted to drive the youngest son don\u0026rsquo;t live, didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to control the speed of the youngest son rushed into the past, this impulse does not matter, a thrill to the gas pedal as a brake, the whole car went straight through the bushes, hit the fence before stopping. The father wanted to back the car out of the bushes to get out of the car, ah, did not expect to feel the rear wheel pressed into something when backing up, rushed to stop down to see, and found that his youngest son was pressed under the wheel, then fainted. The older son told him he ran for more than an hour before catching up with them, and when he saw the scene, he moved the car away, but the younger son was already dead.\n\u0026ldquo;These two people actually said quite similar things, but both said they were the ones driving at the time.\u0026rdquo; The director finally summed it up\n\u0026ldquo;The director concluded, \u0026ldquo;Only one of these two people must be telling the truth, we can\u0026rsquo;t just listen to this, let\u0026rsquo;s see the body.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey? We can check the fingerprints on the steering wheel or DNA to know who was driving the car, right? I can\u0026rsquo;t help but want to praise myself for my own resourcefulness.\n\u0026ldquo;No way! You think about it, the car is often driven by the father, so no matter who the two people say prevails, the car can appear two people\u0026rsquo;s information. The car was originally their own home, so it is quite normal for the three of them to have fingerprints or DNA on the car, which is impossible to judge.\n\u0026ldquo;So is there any video surveillance?\u0026rdquo; I saw that I seemed to have asked a stupid question, and hurriedly thought of another witty one.\n\u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea! The doctor gave me a white look, \u0026ldquo;this article is already remote, and just repaired, there is no time to install. And it was more than 4:00 a.m., there was no one on the road. So, the case has neither video footage nor witnesses. It seems that hope is on the body.\nHearing this from Dr. Sun, I felt a little bit of excitement, it was finally the forensic pathologist\u0026rsquo;s turn to find out the truth!\nAfter investigating the scene, we took the body back to the autopsy room, and Dr. Sun and I did the autopsy while the director was guiding and recording.\n\u0026ldquo;I think this case is different from the past, the key is on the surface of the body, not inside. The director said to me and Sun in a more affirmative tone, \u0026ldquo;Do the body surface more carefully and more detailed.\nI and Sun forensic medicine to take orders, and began to work.\nThe body surface examination found: the deceased\u0026rsquo;s head and face was bruised, bilateral lid conjunctiva congestion, there are a lot of bleeding spots; the left frontal area has a\nPictures\n\u0026ldquo;It seems to be a little more wounded. After the post-mortem, I did not think, \u0026ldquo;two people mentioned the car hit people, car crushed people, a little more injury is not normal?\n\u0026ldquo;You still need to learn more! You look here, here and there first.\u0026rdquo; The director listened to my doubts and pointed to the contusions on the corpse\u0026rsquo;s left calf, left hip and left shoulder and said to me, \u0026ldquo;And the contusion trauma on the head, do these injuries remind you of anything?\n\u0026ldquo;Collision triad!\u0026rdquo; I instantly thought of a knowledge that I remembered from school.\nThe front bumper of the vehicle hits the leg first, because the leg is under the center of gravity, plus the forward speed of the vehicle, the body tumbles, the upper body tilts toward the body, the lower body goes up, the whole person presents a knocked up appearance. After that, the body falls to the hood can form a second impact injury. Because the vehicle has forward speed, and the human body has the inertia of backward motion, it will lead to the human body on the hood to slide backward relative to the car, resulting in the head and shoulders hit the front windshield to form the third injury.\n\u0026ldquo;The person was walking on the side of the road and the car hit from the left side, so these injuries on the left side of the person\u0026rsquo;s leg, hip, shoulder and head should be the collision triad. I was a little excited, \u0026ldquo;I learned the theory back then, but I finally saw a live case today!\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s good, that\u0026rsquo;s a collision triad. The director was happy, \u0026ldquo;This means that the two people\u0026rsquo;s description of the car having an acceleration and then hitting the person should still be credible.\n\u0026ldquo;But that still doesn\u0026rsquo;t distinguish who\u0026rsquo;s telling the truth, does it? Although I answered the question about the triple injury, I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the effect on distinguishing the truth from the falsity of the two people.\nThe director pointed to the contusion band on the chest and said, \u0026ldquo;The key is right here. Take a closer look and see what the characteristics of these contusions are.\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm? There seems to be a bit of a pattern, with little burr-like flaps of skin around the edge of each contusion.\u0026rdquo; I looked down at the contusion with the tire tread.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s good.\u0026rdquo; The director acknowledged my observation, \u0026ldquo;Continue to see what other features?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It seems \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; like they\u0026rsquo;re all in one direction.\u0026rdquo; I studied it a little more closely, \u0026ldquo;Ah! I remember! I remember that this feature can indicate the direction of the force that caused the contusion. In a similar abrasion or contusion in which the epidermis is peeling, the flap is in the direction of the external force acting on it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Very good, very good, so, your conclusion is?\u0026rdquo; The director asked me, still in doubt.\n\u0026ldquo;The direction of the source of this \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; force from the left shoulder to the right axilla is from the shoulder toward the axilla. And the direction from the left shoulder to the right upper arm is from the right arm towards the left shoulder.\u0026rdquo; I thought about it and replied, \u0026ldquo;Eh? No, these two directions are opposite! One is diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, and the other is right to left.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the point I was making. The director seemed to have it all figured out, \u0026ldquo;Take a good look and think about it.\n\u0026ldquo;I see.\u0026rdquo; I understand,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun answered the director\u0026rsquo;s question ahead of me, \u0026ldquo;according to the life response, the two different directions of injury are formed before birth. There is no significant difference other than the direction.\n\u0026ldquo;Well \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; I followed Dr. Sun\u0026rsquo;s words, recalled the case described by the director when I was at the scene, and said to myself.\n\u0026ldquo;The eldest son said he hit his brother, then backed up and crushed him afterwards, then immediately moved the car again. The father said he hit his younger son with his car, then backed up and crushed him, and passed out.\n\u0026ldquo;So the dad was lying! I think a light bulb must have gone off in my head at that time, \u0026ldquo;These two contusion bands were formed when the first reversing car crushed the person and the second moving the car, but because they were both shown as pre-mortem injuries, it means that the interval between the two vehicle movements was relatively short, if, according to the father, the eldest son arrived an hour later to move the car, then the two contusion bands should be distinctly different, one showing pre-mortem injuries and the other showing post-mortem injuries! one shows as post-mortem damage!\u0026rdquo;\nAfter saying this, the atmosphere in the autopsy room felt a sense of relief, after all, a very critical issue in this case had been resolved.\n\u0026ldquo;What about the order in which the two contusion bands were formed? The director seemed to have a problem today.\n\u0026ldquo;The one that runs diagonally from the upper left to the lower right is formed first. The one from the right arm to the left shoulder is the second one. The first time I asked a few questions, Dr. Sun rushed to answer, \u0026ldquo;I remembered the wipe-like blood on the fender above the wheel.\n\u0026ldquo;The deceased had a collision with a triple injury, and he fell from the car with his head backward and his feet forward, according to what I just said. Dr. Sun brought up the content of my answer, \u0026ldquo;Although this collision triple injury caused a lot of injuries, but not necessarily cause death, this time the car backwards is equivalent to his right side to the left side of his body, the wheel force on the body and the direction of wheel rotation is reversed, that is, the direction of the force is from the left to the right. In the process, he formed that wipe-like blood mark from back to front on the left side of that car\u0026rsquo;s fender. And then after moving the car, and is driving forward, this time has been pressed to the body of the deceased, so driving forward, the direction of force is from the right to the left, in line with the performance of those flaps.\n\u0026ldquo;What about falling from the car is head forward, feet backward? I reacted to what Dr. Sun said.\n\u0026ldquo;The possibility of what you said certainly exists, but certainly not in this case. Sun forensics is very confident, \u0026ldquo;because you see this oblique line of contusion belt is just under the clavicle, think about it, if the reverse first pressed from the left shoulder to the right shoulder, although the direction of the skin flap is consistent, but the second time also along the oblique line of that drive down ah, but now the wheel here in the right arm, how can run to the left shoulder there and then out from the armpit? If you drive back the same way and then switch the direction of the diagonal, it will destroy the skin flap form. In fact, the key to say so roundabout is that the junction position of these two contusion zones is in the left shoulder. This must be the starting and ending point of the two wheel movements.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo; I was already slow to react, and with no sleep last night, I was a bit confused and took a while to understand after holding the dissection table.\nThe next autopsy did not reveal anything very special, but the expected injuries: a large subscalp hemorrhage in the left occipital area; fractures of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs on the left side, including two fractures of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th ribs; fractures of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs on the right side, with the 3rd and 5th ribs bent inward and depressed; and about 200 ml of blood in each of the bilateral thoracic cavities. There was blood accumulation in the chest cavity on each side, lacerations in the root of the lungs on both sides, and a ruptured heart.\nWe reported the results of the autopsy to our colleagues in charge of the inquest, and soon came the news that the father of the deceased admitted that he was lying. The reason is simple, when he arrived at the scene to find that his eldest son had done wrong, he did not want to lose one son after the other to go to jail, he used his age as a reason to persuade his eldest son to let him carry things alone, did not expect the eldest son did not follow the pre-discussed to say, and finally the forensic pathologist saw the loophole.\nAs for why the eldest son finally changed his mind and told the truth, he said it was when he found himself crushed his brother, and his father came to protect himself, at that moment he suddenly realized that the whole family for money such extraneous things even to this unmanageable situation, it is really wrong to be wrong, that moment of repentance let him decide to bear the mistakes they made.\nAfter doing the case of the brother who drove his brother to death, I recalled the night before the wife who killed her husband.\nThis death, a lot of human feelings are out.\n(End)\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/10.pojieluoshengmendaodishuicaishikaicheyasirendesiji/","summary":"We have all seen the crime, kill people and then do their best to conceal the facts of the crime, but who has heard of the race to become a murderer?\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to work tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s great, it\u0026rsquo;s great!

Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.\nMy first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first. So, I came to a public security bureau as a small follower, and began the work of \u0026ldquo;trainee forensics\u0026rdquo;.\nThe first day, the director threw me a \u0026ldquo;forensic pathology\u0026rdquo; for me to read, because only freshman year, from the study of these specialized courses is still early, in fact, is also to read a plausible understanding of the. At night, in order not to miss the rare opportunity to learn, I chose to stay in the unit and asked the seniors on duty that day to call me if something came up. However, for several days in a row, it was \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo;, and the feeling of not being able to sleep with something in mind was really unpleasant.\nOne day, I finally waited for the first scene of my life, but in the excitement, I did not expect the first scene was quite heavy.\nThat morning at 5 o\u0026rsquo;clock, I was sleeping in the dark, the pillow phone suddenly rang. I got up from bed with a jolt and grabbed the phone to find that it was the director on duty that day, telling me to gather downstairs and have a scene.\nI quickly got up and dressed, too slow to wait for the elevator, directly from the stairs to the downstairs. But I was the only one downstairs with the chirping crickets, and I waited a few minutes before I saw the director come out with two people yawning. They expressed great appreciation for my positive, while separately recalling the passion of the year when they first joined the workforce - \u0026ldquo;young people are just energetic ah\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;really old hello\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThe scene of the incident was located in the urban-rural area, in front of a street store on the sidewalk of a road. When we arrived at the scene, there were a lot of onlookers gathered around, the first police station to arrive at the alarm has pulled a cordon, while trying to get the onlookers to disperse, but it did not help.\n\u0026ldquo;The first thing to do is to go to the trunk and carry a survey box out. The director explained to me, and then got out of the car to understand the situation.\nI picked up a large box with \u0026ldquo;forensic scene investigation\u0026rdquo; printed on it, bent over the police line and went inside. Thinking about this kind of thing in the past, I can only be a spectator outside, but this time I was able to walk in as a staff member with a cool case in hand, I could feel the eyes of many onlookers around me and the case in my hand, this feeling of being noticed is really great!\nApproaching the scene, first see is a propped open on the ground red umbrella, umbrella below is a bed quilt, can vaguely see a person under the quilt, around the ground scattered with some red and white things, there is a woolen hat covered in the ground. A middle-aged woman who claimed to be the daughter of the deceased said while crying: \u0026ldquo;In the morning \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I just got up \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; heard downstairs \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;someone downstairs shouting \u0026lsquo;dead people\u0026rsquo;, I lay down the window to look at \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; saw a person wearing my mother\u0026rsquo;s clothes lying on the ground \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I came down to see that it was my mother\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;Mom ah \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; why do you want to jump to your death ah!\nWhile the colleagues of the site survey are taking photos to fix the scene, I opened the survey box, took out gloves and handed a pair to the director, he also wore a good pair. When the photos were taken, the director walked up and lifted the woolen hat on the ground first, under the hat is also a puddle of red and white things, a bit like red oil bean flowers look like, the crowd saw this scene issued a gasp.\n\u0026ldquo;This is brain tissue.\u0026rdquo; The director said to me while squatting next to the corpse, \u0026ldquo;Be prepared for a while.\nThe director was just about to move away from the umbrella when the daughter of the deceased rushed over to stop us: \u0026ldquo;The deceased cannot show their faces to the sun! I muttered in my heart \u0026ldquo;What kind of feudal superstitious ideas are these? I looked at the director at the same time.\nThe director stood up and said to the daughter of the deceased, \u0026ldquo;We understand your feelings, but now we have to check the situation to determine how your mother died, what if someone killed your mother? The director went back and forth many times, but the daughter of the deceased just kept repeating \u0026ldquo;A deceased person cannot show his face to the sun!\nDirector to see the communication is not very smooth, called the police first to the daughter of the deceased to the side to record the situation, and then turned to me and said: \u0026ldquo;You play umbrella to her cover, the quilt first lift a little, I first look at the situation. I squatted down, holding an umbrella in one hand, and lifted a corner of the quilt on the ground with the other.\nUnderneath the quilt was a distorted blood-stained face, and on closer inspection, the blood was interspersed with white brain tissue. The director touched the corpse\u0026rsquo;s head and whispered to me: \u0026ldquo;Look at this head has been deformed, I feel there are many more fractures, the left side of this large piece of scalp cracked such a large mouth \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he said as he poked his fingers in. \u0026ldquo;Well \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; deep into the skull, the brain tissue is coming out of here.\u0026rdquo; The director then began to examine the ribs and limbs, the deceased\u0026rsquo;s right elbow twisted into a strange shape under the director\u0026rsquo;s hand, it seems there must be a fracture. The director covered the quilt after the inspection, asked me to put the umbrella back in place, called on me and the daughter of the deceased \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s go up and take a look\u0026rdquo;, and said to go to the door of the unit behind the building.\nThis is a small four-story building, we walked to the fourth floor when we saw a small door above, walked up to find a rooftop, the rooftop has a few color plates built temporary board room, the other side of a vacant lot pulled a few wire, above drying a few pieces of clothing. The daughter of the deceased came over to us and pointed out: \u0026ldquo;My mother lives in that room over there. I saw that the trace survey colleagues are taking pictures and checking the ground, went over and took a look at the probe: the room is a little too much stuff, but it\u0026rsquo;s still neat and tidy, feeling nothing obvious.\n\u0026ldquo;Come and take pictures!\u0026rdquo; I heard the director\u0026rsquo;s voice and looked back to find that the director had gone to the rooftop fence, there was a small bench overturned by the wall, the director poked out half of his body to look down and was calling for people to come over and take pictures. I also went over the probe to look outside and found that this position is exactly to the dead below, but did not find any other special problems. The director reached out to stop me when I wanted to probe a little farther.\n\u0026ldquo;Be careful not to rub! Look what\u0026rsquo;s here!\u0026rdquo; The director pointed to a spot on the fence that I had just immediately brushed against.\n\u0026ldquo;Are these \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; footprints?\u0026rdquo; I followed the director\u0026rsquo;s hand to look at the fence, but found a vague and not very obvious traces, change the angle of observation, and found that it looks like the sole of the forefoot pattern like traces.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a footprint. Now tell me what you think.\u0026rdquo; The director looked at me and said.\nI thought about it: \u0026ldquo;The deceased should have jumped from here!\nThe director nodded: \u0026ldquo;Well, a small part of it is right. But there is a detail you did not notice, you look outside again on the eaves what?\nOnce again, I looked out and saw that outside the rooftop was a small eave made of glazed tiles, only sticking out about 10 cm, and a small piece of dust had been rubbed off the eave, revealing the clean tiles underneath.\n\u0026ldquo;If the man jumped, why would the dust on the eaves be rubbed off?\nSeeing my face confused, the director went on to say: \u0026ldquo;You are just now in contact with these, it is normal to think not understand. The deceased is a very old lady, just now when I checked I found that her body muscle atrophy is very serious, which indicates that she died before a long period of bed rest, the body should be quite weak. She can climb this fence is already very difficult, where there is strength to \u0026lsquo;jump\u0026rsquo; down? And you see where she was lying on the ground is not much farther from the eaves of the house, so she should have climbed the fence and then slid down head first, against the eaves.\n\u0026ldquo;Director, then how did you determine that she slipped headfirst and was not picked up and thrown? I asked a question.\nThe director praised: \u0026ldquo;Very good! You are thinking very carefully. You look around the ground is very rough concrete, this ground is difficult to leave obvious footprints, and this is next to the drying clothes, there are footprints in addition to the dead is not surprising. But this small bench and the edge of the platform are only a footprint, looks very similar pattern, so I presume that the deceased stepped on the small bench that fell over, climbing the fence themselves. As for why the head down, you say it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well! I just read in the book you gave me yesterday that \u0026rsquo;there is a close relationship between the part of the ground and the injury received\u0026rsquo;. I spoke carefully while watching the director\u0026rsquo;s face, and found that he was slowly nodding his head, so I gained some more confidence. I continued: \u0026ldquo;We just saw the injuries to the head and limbs of the deceased below were obvious, so you presumed that it should be a head-down fall.\n\u0026ldquo;Very good! We need to combine all kinds of phenomena and detailed information in our forensic practice, which requires a lot of practice to accumulate experience, and we should often do this kind of thinking by heart. The director showed a little smile, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go, we did not find anything unusual, it should be the old lady\u0026rsquo;s own suicide. Let\u0026rsquo;s go ask the family again to see what they say.\u0026rdquo;\nWe found the daughter of the deceased again, we explained to her what we thought, and the daughter also said her guesses. It turns out that the old lady has not been in good health, more than half a year ago was diagnosed with cancer, in order to cure the disease sold the house but nothing, after spending all the savings is even no place to live, desperate under the only way to relatives, relatives can not live, on the roof of the building built a temporary house to live. After this, the old lady\u0026rsquo;s health is worse every day.\nThe daughter of the deceased looked at the place where her mother had lived and finally said, \u0026ldquo;My mother didn\u0026rsquo;t want to keep dragging us down, right?\nThis was my first time on the scene, my first time seeing a real death.\nAlthough freshman year in school just after learning anatomy, have seen the corpse, but also hands-on autopsy contact, but after all, it is a formalin-treated corpse, although the first time I saw the heart still shocked, but a semester down to get used to it, it is only as ordinary as the daily see the teacher. But this time I actually saw the death around me, and I personally felt the grief of the family.\nOn the way back, the chief saw me sitting in the car and said, \u0026ldquo;This is the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve seen such a scene, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? The police is a grounded job and can see the dark side of society. We are the police when the forensic is to see the people and things related to life and death, the death of a person ah, a lot of human feelings and warmth will come out. If you also come to public security as a forensic scientist, you will encounter more dark, negative things, you have to learn to keep yourself a clear heart ah.\nI am now working, although not a police officer, but also a forensic scientist. I have always taken to heart what the director said back then, and have been trying to practice it.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/2.fayishengyadediyicixianchang/","summary":"But all the things in this world, there is a first time. Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.\nMy first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first.","title":"2. Forensic career of the 'first' scene"},{"content":"In the above scene, the deceased died by falling from a height, which is commonly known as \u0026ldquo;jumping\u0026rdquo;. Injuries caused by collision between the human body and the ground or certain objects during the fall are called fall injuries. The form and degree of injury are influenced by the height of the fall, the weight, the presence or absence of obstructions during the fall, the landing method, the landing area, the condition of the ground, and many other factors.\nAccording to the physical knowledge, the greater the weight, the higher the height, the human body after the fall by the impact force is also greater, the more serious the damage suffered. Therefore, often fall from the same height of the child will be lighter than the adult injury is very much, there have been from more than ten floors because of the accidental fall of the child, fell on the car cushioned and then survive the news.\nThe most common parts of a fall are the head, heel and buttocks. When the head first hits the ground, the scalp can be cracked, skull and cervical vertebrae can be fractured, brain tissue can also be injured, the most serious is the occurrence of skull burst, brain tissue is severely damaged and rapid death, as in the case above; and if the lower limbs land vertically, in addition to fractures, trauma, landing vibration to the body, the rupture of internal organs and extensive fractures can occur; when the back, buttocks and other flat landing When the back, buttocks and other plane landing, if the height is not high, because the contact area is wide, the injury is often lighter than other parts of the same conditions of landing, but often fractures of the spine.\nTo summarize the injury of high fall, there are several characteristics.\nThe injury is heavy inside and light outside. Many high falls, the body surface seems to be no serious injury, in fact, may have occurred in multiple fractures, internal organs may also have ruptured causing internal bleeding.\nMultiple injuries are formed by a one-time violence. Injuries on the body can be explained by a single external force. If there is a need for multiple actions to form, it is often necessary to consider the possibility that there was already an injury before the fall.\nThe distribution of injuries is characteristic. Because the fall injury is basically an instant, so the injury is often concentrated on one side of the body or a certain direction, mostly direct landing position.\nDamage for the general manpower is difficult to form. The impact of a high fall is generally large, so the whole body caused by multiple fractures, and even limb transection, this injury is generally only rely on human power, or the use of tools to combat are difficult or impossible to form.\nOnce in a construction site on a very typical high fall.\nThe site is digging the foundation, the whole site is a deep pit. A worker was carrying cables on the ground, and he did not notice the clutter of cables under his feet. When the machine pulling the cables started, he tripped over the cables under his feet and fell from a height of about 30 meters to the foundation pit, which was almost 10 stories high.\nWhen we arrived at the scene, we saw the deceased lying on his back on the large and small debris at the bottom of the foundation pit. The worker who witnessed the whole process said that he fell face down at that time, and only when the 120 first aid people came to check him over.\nA brief examination of the body at the scene: the bones of both arms have been broken into several pieces, the right wrist has broken bones pierced the skin, like a spear, the right leg twisted to a peculiar shape pressed under the body; although the entire cranium felt nothing obviously broken, dislocation, but from his nostrils, ears, mouth have flowed a large amount of blood, a closer look at the blood flowing out of the ears and This is usually a sign of a skull base fracture; the \u0026ldquo;fluctuating sensation\u0026rdquo; of feeling the stomach like a balloon that is filled with water means that there is a lot of fluid in the stomach, which is often the result of a large blood vessel or organ rupture in the abdominal cavity causing hemorrhage.\nIn the above manifestations, whether it is a fracture of the arm, a fracture of the right leg, a fracture of the base of the skull, or a hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity, this can be explained by a one-time formation from a fall of about 10 floors, and there is no other apparently lethal injury on the body surface except for bleeding from the wrist and mouth, nose, and ear. The fracture at the base of the skull, the damage to the brain tissue, and the massive bleeding in the abdominal cavity are serious enough to constitute a fatal injury. Therefore, this is a very typical high fall in comparison to the above characteristics of high falls.\nHowever, these characteristics are only theoretical high fall characteristics, in practice, due to a variety of factors and completely different situation, the actual work should be based on the specific situation to specific analysis.\nThe theory is dead, and the application of the theory is alive.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/3.gaozhuizhihouhuifashengshenme/","summary":"In the above scene, the deceased died by falling from a height, which is commonly known as \u0026ldquo;jumping\u0026rdquo;.

What happens after a high fall"},{"content":"Those with distinctive features and multiple eyewitnesses of the high fall is easier to determine the nature of death, defined as an accident or suicide is a relatively simple matter, after the investigation there is no obvious doubt also generally do not need to be dissected; witnesses are sufficient, the family of the deceased usually will not have any questions. If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.\nIn my last semester of college, I had to go to the Public Security Bureau for a six-month internship. At this time, I had already learned my professional knowledge and needed to combine it with practice to better understand and master the application of this theoretical knowledge.\nAt 8:00 a.m., I was eating breakfast in the cafeteria, and as soon as I sat down, forensic scientist Sun, who was on duty that day, received a call: \u0026ldquo;A body was found in the river under a bridge, according to the public. I quickly pick up the bowl of rice, put on the \u0026ldquo;scene investigation\u0026rdquo; vest, get in the police car whistled to the scene.\nThe scene is under a highway bridge. This bridge on both sides of the non-motorized road and the middle of the motorway are parallel to the three bridges, the river under the bridge is not much, the flow is not very fast, the body is prone position soaked in the river, the motorway bridge is blocked by the second pier.\n\u0026ldquo;Notify the fire department to salvage the body? Sun forensics looked at the situation under the bridge after asking a small civilian police officer on the scene.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ll be here soon! Dr. Sun, you\u0026rsquo;re on duty again today, you see every time we go to work together, it\u0026rsquo;s always bad! This must not be a case!\u0026rdquo; (Many police officers call it a \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo; only if it involves a crime, but not if it can be ruled out.) The young police officer obviously knew Dr. Sun and came up to greet him, \u0026ldquo;Who is this?\n\u0026ldquo;This is the new intern student who came in a few days ago. Sun forensic doctor saw the police pointed at me, replied, \u0026ldquo;students who come to practice are looking forward to having a scene to move hands, we are the opposite, right?\n\u0026ldquo;That is of course, we work, certainly do not want to catch things when they are on duty, who wants to die? But this can not be helped, who made us do this business! The small police handed a cigarette to Sun forensics, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquo;Young people follow Sun forensics learn well, he is the best forensics here.\nAs we speak, the fire department has come, several young soldiers put on waterproof equipment, took the body bags we handed over and began to go down the river to retrieve the body.\nWatching the fire fighters tripped the river to the body next to the body in the body, Sun forensic shouted to them: \u0026ldquo;Do not rub the bottom of the river, do not touch the rocks! This is to prevent additional artificial damage on the corpse, bringing unnecessary trouble to the later autopsy.\nForensic scientist Sun led me to separate the weeds on the shore, a large circle to the river, the fire fighters have pulled the body to the shore. Sun forensics commanded the fire fighters to put the body flat on a slightly flatter riverbed, turned his head to look around as if looking for something, looked for a while to me to extend a hand. I understood the head down from the body of a vest pocket pulled out the mask, and from another pocket pulled out the gloves, rummaging and took out a ruler.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, you are really prepared ah, is simply a mobile survey box, the survey box and heavy, commonly used on those few things but to carry, some places that is really hard ah, the future do not need to bring a box, bring you a enough. Dr. Sun watched with interest as I took out one thing after another from my body like a magic trick.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s not make fun of me, let\u0026rsquo;s see the body first. This full of pockets of the \u0026ldquo;scene investigation\u0026rdquo; vest in the pockets of all kinds of commonly used supplies, this is still the habit of the previous apprenticeship, otherwise sometimes to some inconvenient place to work with the box is very affected.\nI also put on a pair of gloves, squatting down and began to find the zipper of the body bag. I did not expect to pull open the body bag, a huge wound on the top of the head appeared directly in front of our eyes, it looks like something hit out. Seeing this wound, Dr. Sun put away his smile just now, and his demeanor became serious.\nSun stopped me from reaching out to check the wound, and instead asked me to look through my pockets first, looking for ID cards, driver\u0026rsquo;s licenses and other things that can prove identity. I found a cell phone in the pocket of the leather jacket worn by the deceased, and found a neatly folded 1447 yuan, a set of keys and a pack of cigarettes in the pocket of the lower body jeans, nothing to directly prove the identity of the things. Sun told me to put the phone in a separate evidence bag and put the rest back in place first: \u0026ldquo;Take the body back and check it carefully, it\u0026rsquo;s likely to be a case.\nDeep and shallow to carry the body on the bridge, the investigation colleagues immediately gathered around and asked: \u0026ldquo;Well? Is it a case?\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet, but you\u0026rsquo;d better be prepared. This cell phone for you, go first to determine the source of the body. Hearing the words of forensic scientist Sun, the colleagues of the investigation have expressed their unhappiness.\nBefore leaving the scene, forensic scientist Sun again saw the small civilian police, to him a frown: \u0026ldquo;can not be? Really a case ah?\u0026rdquo; The young police officer was immediately nervous.\n\u0026ldquo;It seems you have to stay at the scene for a while longer. The police officer said, \u0026ldquo;I need an autopsy to be sure.\nBack to the autopsy room, Dr. Sun took out two sets of disposable surgical gowns and handed me a set: \u0026ldquo;The first few times I saw you do pretty well, today you\u0026rsquo;ll be the main knife, I\u0026rsquo;ll be your assistant.\nUsually corpse inspection requires at least two people to cooperate with each other to complete, generally will stand on the right hand side of the corpse called the \u0026ldquo;main knife\u0026rdquo;, because the right hand holds the knife, then, from this direction to operate from head to toe, relatively smooth, and the main knife is also the main examination and report the autopsy findings of the person.\nDress up, put on the mask, gloves, first surface inspection of the body. After taking off all the clothes, what caught the eye was one after another old scars, and a tattoo was found on the arm. I and Sun forensic medicine with the body rinsed clean, towel dry water stains, Sun forensic medicine turned to take pictures of colleagues said: \u0026ldquo;the face and the tattoo first photographed and sent to the investigation, to provide them with some clues to find people again.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, you to determine the time of his death. Hearing the question of Sun forensic pathologist, my heart is a little bottomless, although these are learned in professional classes, but really put the theory into practice, or a little less confident.\nAccording to the textbook, the time of death in the early stages of death can be inferred from measuring the temperature of the body, but the body is soaked in water, relying on the temperature may deviate more. In addition to the temperature of the corpse, can also be inferred from some early corpse phenomena, including the formation of the site of rigor mortis, intensity, press the corpse spot can fade, check the degree of corneal clouding, and so on. When undressing just now, we found that the limbs were not much stiffness, pressed the chin of the corpse, and raised the head, and found that there was a little stiffness in the jaw and neck. The back of the corpse spot can fade with a light press. Pick up the tweezers to turn over the eyelids, the cornea is clear and transparent, no clouding at all.\nAfter doing the above, I silently thought for a moment, looked up at the clock on the wall: \u0026ldquo;I think the time of death should be less than 5 hours, it is now 10:25, that \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; probably died at about 5:00 this morning. The first thing you need to do is look at Dr. Sun with a little bit of weakness.\n\u0026ldquo;Not bad, theoretically okay. Sun forensic doctor first affirmed my answer, \u0026ldquo;but I think the time can be set a little longer, more than 6 hours it. The weather is not too hot, and the body is soaking in the water, in the low temperature environment stiffness will appear a little slower. And, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you noticed, at the scene, his face was dark red, at that time did not look closely at the injury or other, but now you see, the dark red face has faded a lot, so this should be the corpse spots, the back also appeared corpse spots.\n\u0026ldquo;I know! At the scene, the body is lying prone in the water, according to reason corpse spots should appear in front of the body, chest, face such, so then at the scene to see the face of the dark red should be corpse spots, but now the face of the corpse spots disappeared, but the back appeared corpse spots, this is the phenomenon of transfer of corpse spots. After Dr. Sun\u0026rsquo;s reminder, I remembered a phenomenon when the corpse spots first began to form.\nContinuing to check the body surface, there were some small abrasions on the face, mainly concentrated on the nose, the arch of the eyebrows, and the temporal region (located on both sides of the head, behind both eyes, and above the cheekbones, which is roughly the area near the temples). There were also some small abrasions on the back of the left hand and bilateral knees. The abrasions had a clear reaction to life, indicating that they should have been caused prenatally.\nThe body surface, apart from these minor abrasions, left the large trauma on the top of the head. I inserted a cotton swab into the wound and wiped around, and took it out and found some black sediment-like material on it.\n\u0026ldquo;This is no characteristic, the body is soaking in the river, the river\u0026rsquo;s sediment or something inevitably washed in by the water, if you find some brick chips, wood chips and so on can also explain some problems. Despite what Dr. Sun said, or let the photo colleagues to take pictures of the mud and sand above the swab fixed.\nI rinsed the wound with water and aligned the edges, and found that the entire wound was roughly in the shape of a \u0026ldquo;χ\u0026rdquo;, with the scalp and skull separated in the middle of the cross, and extending deeper to the sides, presenting a pouch-like appearance between the scalp and the skull.\n\u0026ldquo;The trauma base was uneven, the trauma margin was not smooth, and there were intertissue bridges between the trauma walls.\u0026rdquo; I reported these findings while examining, \u0026ldquo;This is typical of blunt force trauma.\n\u0026ldquo;And what is this pouch-like appearance?\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun asked again.\nI searched my mind and thought about what I had read in books and what the teacher had said in class, but there was no mention of blunt force trauma showing such signs, so I shook my head and said I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\n\u0026ldquo;I finally got it!\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun laughed, \u0026ldquo;this performance is generally caused by a relatively large area of objects, previously encountered an iron plate slapped on the head, also appeared this performance. It does not matter, forensics is practice, see more naturally know.\nThe next step is to dissect, after cutting open the scalp, see the sagittal suture of the skull (located at the top of the human head, a longitudinal bone seam from front to back) and the left side of the herringbone suture (a horizontal bone seam located at the back of the head) has been cracked. After removing the skull, there was a thin layer of hematoma outside the dura on the right side, and there was hemorrhage from the subarachnoid space in both the prefrontal location of the brain and the cerebellum.\nWhen I did this, I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;This was clearly hit with a blunt object of the type that the teacher just described, so this person was killed and then dumped in the river! I\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s it! This must be the case!\u0026rdquo;\nAfter the head, the thoracic and abdominal cavities were opened next. The surface of the lungs in the chest cavity had obvious indentation of the ribs, and there was a \u0026ldquo;twisted hair\u0026rdquo; feeling when squeezed by hand (kind of like squeezing a lock of hair and twisting it around), and red bloody fluid came out of the cut surface of the lungs. When the esophagus was opened, there was a small amount of sediment-like material adhering to the wall of the esophagus. The trachea was cut open and a large amount of white foamy fluid was found in the trachea. In the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum on the surface of the spleen was crumpled and the entire spleen was anemic in appearance. Other than that, there were no abnormal findings.\nAfter the autopsy, I was confused again: the damage seen in the head was enough to cause the person to die of cranio-cerebral injury, thinking that there would be no additional findings in the chest and abdominal cavity, but how come there were so many manifestations of drowning death by entering the water before birth?\n\u0026ldquo;Teacher, this person\u0026rsquo;s lungs showed typical signs of \u0026ldquo;watery emphysema\u0026rdquo;, and sediment and foam were found in the esophagus and trachea, as well as anemia of the spleen. These are all signs of drowning. I began to feel a little dizzy, so I had to ask the teacher for help, \u0026ldquo;The injury on this person\u0026rsquo;s head was caused by a blunt instrument, but this was followed by the manifestations of drowning. So, how exactly is the cause of death determined?\u0026rdquo;\nSun forensics did not directly answer my question, if thought for a while, decided to go back to the scene to see.\nBack to the scene, I and Sun forensic yards of highway, from one side to find the other, but did not find any useful information. Forensic scientist Sun and I were lying on the railing looking at the position of the body in the water in the morning.\n\u0026ldquo;Teacher.\u0026rdquo; I broke the silence first, \u0026ldquo;this person has a large head wound, such a large wound bleeding must be very ferocious, if it was wounded here, then the ground should leave a blood trail, right? Even if this is just a body dumping site, the transfer process should also have blood left ah. Could it be that it was floated down from upstream?\u0026rdquo;\nSun forensic doctor as if I did not hear what I was saying, lit a cigarette and still looking at the river dazed. I look at the water, and then look at Sun forensic, and did not know what he was looking at.\nA cigarette soon finished, Dr. Sun casually threw into the river, the cigarette sank in the water and floated away with the current. Suddenly, Dr. Sun \u0026ldquo;Huh\u0026rdquo;, asked me: \u0026ldquo;There is paper?\nI am more puzzled, turned out a packet of Kleenex handed to Sun forensics, he pulled out a ball into a small ball, like just threw the paper into the river, the ball of paper floated away with the current, and the direction of the floating away is - the second bridge pier!\nI stared at the ball of paper seemed to think of something, grabbed the tissue paper in the hands of Dr. Sun, also pulled out a ball into a ball and threw it down, the ball of paper once again drifted to the second pier there.\n\u0026ldquo;From the flow of the river, it really is floating down from above. I was a little frustrated, this kind of \u0026ldquo;river drift\u0026rdquo; often brings trouble to solve the case. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s even a problem to identify the person.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\u0026rdquo; I think this is not a case now, but I need to get the fire department to confirm a few questions first. Forensic scientist Sun took out his cell phone and started calling the fire department in the morning, asking questions about the riverbed and the depth of the water.\nAfter hanging up the phone, Dr. Sun said to me happily, \u0026ldquo;I have an answer, they told me that the riverbed under the bridge is different from the rocky beach on the shore, the riverbed here is flat, basically no rocks, just a big concrete slab! And, there is an important information, they went down in the morning, the deepest water is just to the calf, the river is not much deeper!\nListened to the words of Sun Forensic, I immediately understood his meaning; the body head injury is not at all hit by others with blunt instruments, but from the bridge jumped to the river high fall formed. Because the river is not deep, the deceased\u0026rsquo;s head directly on the flat riverbed formed the head of that large wound, and this impact did not let him die immediately, only because of cranial damage and fainted, after the drowning occurred, and finally washed by the water to the second pier under the location of the body was found.\nLater investigators retrieved the highway surveillance video, the video shows 4:42 in the morning, a figure appeared on the bridge, in the bridge from one end to the other, back and forth several times after walking, stopped at the guardrail looking at the bridge below, about 5 minutes later over the guardrail, and then fell head first. Because of the distance, coupled with dim street lights, it is impossible to see the face, but look very much like the deceased dressed. Later contacted the family of the deceased through the cell phone card has not been damaged, the family confirmed that the person in the video is the deceased.\nFinally, the cause of death on the forensic medical opinion was written: \u0026ldquo;cranio-cerebral injury due to high fall, combined with drowning death\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo;, my mind was limited to the first sight of the head wound, while preconceived notions that the wound was inflicted with a blunt object because of its obvious blunt force trait. But just like the final result, blunt force injury is not necessarily a blunt object to hit the head, hitting the head with a blunt object can also be formed, so that the \u0026ldquo;sac-like\u0026rdquo; performance under the wound can also be explained through, the flat riverbed acted as a special blunt object. Moreover, because of the buffering effect of the river also makes the body does not appear in the high fall in the often occurring multiple fractures, internal organs also did not appear obvious rupture, lost a lot of high fall injury characteristics.\nThis once again reflects the forensic not only to pay attention to the body itself, but also to pay attention to the situation of the scene environment, to avoid the first conclusion and then find evidence of the way of thinking, to think outside the box to crack the problem.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/4.hezhongfushifayiruhequedingsizhedesiwangshijian/","summary":"Those with distinctive features and multiple eyewitnesses of the high fall is easier to determine the nature of death, defined as an accident or suicide is a relatively simple matter, after the investigation there is no obvious doubt also generally do not need to be dissected; witnesses are sufficient, the family of the deceased usually will not have any questions. If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.","title":"4. Floating body in the river: how does the forensic pathologist determine the time of death of the deceased?"},{"content":"In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed. Originally this furniture city because of the remote location, closing time early every day, business has been difficult to do, today there is actually a corpse inexplicably appeared. Now it was completely out of business.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really bad luck,\u0026rdquo; Mr. Jin whined to us while leading us to the entrance of his store, pointing to the ceiling and saying to us, \u0026ldquo;Look, I was the last one to leave at 6 pm last night, and everything was fine when it closed, and now it\u0026rsquo;s like this. Hey \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; tell us what this is all about!\nAn hour ago, I was lying in my chair after breakfast, and the warm but not sunny autumn sun was coming in through the window. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to sleep like this, no phone calls, no scenes, no corpses, nothing! After a big stretch, I adjusted my posture, thinking to enjoy the beautiful sunshine first, and then work later.\n\u0026ldquo;~~~~~\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No way! My spell of \u0026ldquo;Flag\u0026rdquo; is working again! I wailed, grabbed the phone, and the voice of the forensic scientist on duty today came over the phone: \u0026ldquo;On site! See you in the garage.\u0026rdquo;\nNo way, death does not care if the weather is good today. In fact, this feeling of the unknown is one of the main reasons why I like forensics, I don\u0026rsquo;t always know what kind of scene or body is waiting for me.\nB city is really big, after driving for more than an hour, we crossed the whole city to reach a furniture market in the suburbs, met with Mr. Jin, and the conversation at the beginning happened.\nDr. Sun and I looked up in the direction of Mr. Jin\u0026rsquo;s finger and first saw two rickety fluorescent lights. The fluorescent lights were supposed to be hung by two chains, but now only the chain on one side was still hanging strong. Looking upward along this chain, the color steel tile I-beam on the ceiling was dented, and the dented position happened to have an I-beam passing by.\n\u0026ldquo;I came to open the door at 7:00 this morning, there was a puddle of soil on the ground at that time, I did not see it at first, so I swept the puddle away, what\u0026rsquo;s the impact? Boss Jin asked us a little shortness.\nDr. Sun took a look at Mr. Jin, waved his hand and said: \u0026ldquo;This is not a big problem, we want to go to the top to see how we can go up? Is there a staircase?\u0026rdquo;\nMr. Jin smiled bitterly: \u0026ldquo;This furniture city is built with color steel tiles and steel beams, just one floor, more than 7 meters high, at the beginning did not think to go up often, there is no special channel, only a small window can climb up. But I found this situation in the morning after also want to go up to see what is going on, from that window to drill up, up to see a black mass of things, get closer to see a hand. This scares me, I climbed down and called the police, almost did not fall down at the window! Jin boss took us to this temporary small channel, a ladder to a prominent platform, a small window on the platform, there is no protection measures, it does not look too reliable dangerous look.\nDr. Sun looked at the \u0026ldquo;temporary\u0026rdquo; channel, decided to call the fire department to ask for support. Ten minutes later, a ladder truck from the fire department came to the scene. After putting on the safety protection equipment, Sun and I were sent to the roof of the furniture city on the small platform of the ladder truck.\nThe roof of the furniture city is not a platform, but both sides with a little slope, far from the past, in the ridge a little bit off the location of the color steel tile has a pit, the pit has a black mass of things. I and Sun forensics carefully along the ridge of the steel beam to the front, you can see that it is indeed a male corpse, lying on his back, but the body is black, the head is also covered by the clothes can not see the face, but also a little seemingly odor.\nSun forensics and other photographers finished taking pictures, and I carefully approached to check. I reached over and pulled the clothes down a little, and what caught my eye was a mix of black, brown, coffee-colored face, and the stench was a little more intense.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I know it\u0026rsquo;s a person, and people are dead on the line. This is not safe up here, let\u0026rsquo;s go down and look at the details, first come help me put the body in the bag. Sun forensics said to me while laying out the body bag.\nLoad the body, we followed together with the ladder truck back to the ground, feet on the ground feels really good. The body bag was opened by Dr. Sun and I in a small open space surrounded by several cars, and the stench was even stronger than before.\n\u0026ldquo;It was bad luck that it was a corpse that had decayed. Although I muttered in my heart, my hands did not stop, quickly laying out the body bag on the ground for photography and inspection.\nSun forensic doctor looked over the body, I probe over while looking at the record: \u0026ldquo;gloves, footwear\u0026rdquo; have been formed, the fingers of one hand or dry state; body skin color because of corruption and black, some places there are small pieces of yellow, most places can not see the original skin color in the end what is. The top is in a state of upward cover the head, near the head to see some plastic bags, plastic bags in the middle to reveal a little hair, is a short thin black curly hair, a little like the black race is very common in the kind of small curly hair.\n\u0026ldquo;This looks like a black man?\u0026rdquo; I saw the hair after asking Dr. Sun forensics. The forensic scientist Sun did not deny, turned down the top to reveal the head, forehead position there is a plastic bag made of rings, loosely wrapped around the head. Sun forensics to the body left and right turned over, this turn, the plastic ring above the skull as a whole deformed.\n\u0026ldquo;The fracture of the skull is quite serious, it has broken into many pieces, I do not know if there are other fractures in the body, it seems to go back to take an X-ray and then take a closer look. Dr. Sun used his hands to stabilize the skull and carefully examined both sides, and found something stuffed in both ears, and took out small plastic fragments. I was thinking about what the significance of these things, I heard Dr. Sun say to me: \u0026ldquo;Come on, you deduce the time of death.\nMy heart was very apprehensive. Time of death inference is quite an important part of forensic work, inferring the time of death to determine the time of the crime, identify and exclude the suspect has no time to commit the crime, delineate the scope of investigation and even the final detection of the case are important, this work is quite dependent on experience and technology, need to rely on all aspects of information to make a comprehensive judgment, basically at the scene according to a variety of early body performance to determine the best Can be accurate in the range of a few hours, such as the location of the stiffness, intensity, such as the location of the corpse spot, finger pressure whether fading, such as the degree of corneal clouding, and so on - the actual work for the short time of death can be used to measure the temperature of the body to determine, this is still more accurate. However, like this time this has been corrupted, especially or has been highly corrupted, a variety of early cadaveric phenomena have long disappeared, if based on the changes in corruption to infer, the accuracy of this time may only reach the range of a few days. The time of death of highly corrupt bodies can be said to have been a nightmare for forensic pathologists.\n\u0026ldquo;This \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; this \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; skin discoloration is very serious, the gloves, footwear should be the formation of epidermal peeling due to corruption, these days has been 20 degrees of temperature, so look The words, almost \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; a week?\u0026rdquo; I replied with great apprehension.\n\u0026ldquo;I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s been at least a week, so you\u0026rsquo;re being conservative. But how come there are no maggots? I don\u0026rsquo;t see any maggots at this level of decay, but the flies have just come to lay their eggs. Dr. Sun pointed to a yellow-white fly eggs on the body\u0026rsquo;s clothes and said to me: \u0026ldquo;It seems that this should not be the first scene of his death. Let\u0026rsquo;s pull the body back and examine it in detail, maybe there is useful information hidden in his body.\nWhen we got back to the autopsy room, we took a full-body x-ray of the body. In addition to the expected finding of \u0026ldquo;crushed skull fracture,\u0026rdquo; we also found \u0026ldquo;four fractured ribs, two fractures and deformations in the spine, and multiple fractures and deformations in the pelvis. In addition to this, age-related information was unexpectedly found: the epiphysis of the corpse was not yet closed, and it was still clear! This means that he was less than 20 years old at the time of death.\nThe next step was the post-mortem examination. First was the clothing. When the forensic pathologist is confronted with a nameless body of unknown origin, an important task is to look for information on the body and at the scene that can determine the identity of the body, this body has nothing at the scene, now we have to see if there is anything on the body to prove who he is and where he came from.\nThe deceased\u0026rsquo;s upper body is two long-sleeved pullover threads, in a state of semi-dress, the left arm has come out of the sleeve, the right side is still normal wear; lower body two pants, the outside jeans are covered with black oil and dust, the button has disappeared, the trouser pocket nothing, inside is a gray fall pants and red underwear; feet are barefoot state, not wearing shoes, and no socks. Forensic scientist Sun and I took off the clothes on the body one by one, laying them flat on the ground, examining them and taking pictures. Sun forensics said to me: \u0026ldquo;Look at these clothes are Made in where, or for us to guess where this is from people to provide some reference.\nHowever, the results were devastating. The corpse was wearing a total of five pieces of clothing, two tops from Macau, China and Bangladesh, two pants from Mongolia and El Salvador, and the innermost pair of red underwear had no trademark information, but the front of the underwear had an upside-down \u0026ldquo;Fu\u0026rdquo; and a dragon printed on the underwear, so it was estimated that the underwear was from China. Originally, I thought I could roughly guess the possible countries from the clothes I was wearing, but this time I was completely confused: there were five pieces of clothing, but they came from five places! It seems that we can only go to DNA to determine.\nAfter checking the clothes and returning to the autopsy table, I noticed a small piece of orange \u0026ldquo;cloth\u0026rdquo; pressed under the body\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. Dr. Sun told me to give this piece of cloth to others to check the source, handed me a hose to rinse the body, so as to see whether there are any injuries on the surface.\nThe upper body is nothing unusual, but when rinsing to the lower body, in the left thigh inside found a large area of broken skin, the broken area has no epidermis, the muscles on the thigh are exposed, in the edge of the broken skin can be seen with the whole thigh at a fixed angle of the slope. Seeing this damage, Dr. Sun went back to pick up the pants and began to check the corresponding location, and found that the corresponding location on the pants but not broken.\n\u0026ldquo;I took a scalpel and cut a small opening perpendicular to the edge of the broken skin, \u0026ldquo;there is no bleeding under the skin, so to speak, there is no reaction to life, this injury should be formed after death. But the pants are not even broken ah, where did the injury come from?\u0026rdquo; I was already going crazy with this inexplicable corpse: first the inexplicable appeared in the inexplicable place, then his inexplicable identity, inexplicable clothes, inexplicable wounds \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; everything is inexplicable!\nSun forensics looked at my anxious look, calmly said: \u0026ldquo;Do not rush well, all the performance is certainly a reasonable explanation, just now has not found the key information that can be linked together. I see this leg injury is very much like the kind of squeezed friction formed, the pants are not damaged while the skin is worn out. Be patient, let\u0026rsquo;s finish the autopsy first.\u0026rdquo;\nI pouted behind the mask and patiently continued to do the autopsy with Dr. Sun.\nThe autopsy only found that the skull was severely broken, however the fractures were still not life responsive, which means that the skull fractures were also all formed after death. The stomach was empty, other internal organs were not found anything special, and because of the serious corruption can not be seen a subtle, extracted the blood in the heart, a small piece of liver and kidneys sent to do routine toxicology, cut off a small piece of rib cartilage to do DNA identification.\nThe autopsy is even a temporary end, but did not solve any problems, but let things become more confusing. The first question is: Who is he? Where did he come from?\n\u0026ldquo;The gold boss said only that a small window can drill up, that small window living people drill in are laborious, the body was carried up should be very difficult; if two living people to the top of the fight, was killed by the fall, but the time on the night is not possible to rot to such an extent, can make the I-beam bending, people do not have so much strength. And that pit, it\u0026rsquo;s as precise as tailor-made.\u0026rdquo; I silently thought of several possibilities, \u0026ldquo;and at the scene when I looked at the surrounding environment, the surrounding than the furniture city and then higher than the high-voltage electricity transmission tower, however, the closest one is also in a hundred meters away from the furniture city.\n\u0026ldquo;Forget it, do not think, we should go back to the scene to see it, the autopsy now get the information we still have to combine with the scene to see ah. Sun forensic doctor patted my shoulder and went out to drive away.\nBack to the furniture city, the cordon has not been withdrawn, the face than noon and also ugly gold boss saw us back, rushed to meet up and said: \u0026ldquo;You guys see if you can discuss, today because of this thing has been most of the day no business, now can not this cordon first withdrawn? I\u0026rsquo;m not doing business for a day, the rent really can not afford ah! Last year, a large ice cube fell on the roof in broad daylight has made me shut down a few days of business. This year, well, directly to a corpse, this shitty place feng shui problems, after the remaining months, next year I\u0026rsquo;m sure to leave, dead or alive, not to do here.\nI and Sun forensics heard here at the same time shouted: \u0026ldquo;ice fell on the roof?\nMr. Jin was startled: \u0026ldquo;Ah? Ice? Oh yes! Last summer, a sunny day, I was talking business that afternoon, a loud bang above my head almost scared me to death, when I climbed up from that small window to see, there was a big ice cube on the roof.\nAs we spoke, there was a roar above us, and we looked up to see a huge plane flying overhead. Jin boss then said: \u0026ldquo;We were guessing that the ice should fall from the sky, is not the aircraft on the do not know, but this happens to be the route of the airport, the aircraft passed quite frequently. Sun and I looked up at the sky, and in the distance came the sound of aircraft roar, a small black dot slowly turned into a plane, and finally flew over our heads.\n\u0026ldquo;Could it be that the body came down from the plane? I can not believe it, \u0026ldquo;the plane is flying in the sky normally, certainly not open the door to throw things, besides, the body is rotten like this, really who threw down, can not be rotten overnight like this, right? Dr. Sun looked at the plane that was flying over and instructed me to take a good look at the plane again.\nIn the distance, there happens to be another plane flying over, and as it approaches, the plane is getting bigger and bigger. Suddenly, a door opened on the belly of the plane and the landing gear was released. \u0026ldquo;Ah!!! I got it!\u0026rdquo; It finally dawned on me, \u0026ldquo;This is the landing route of the plane, when the plane flies to this neighborhood to release the landing gear in preparation for landing, so the body most likely fell out of the landing gear bin and smashed into the roof of the furniture city. In this way, the bent I-beam, falling fluorescent lights and dust, just the right pit, and multiple post-mortem fractures throughout his body, these would all make sense.\u0026rdquo;\nForensic scientist Sun nodded approvingly and said to Mr. Jin, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there should be nothing more over here, let me say hello to them and remove this cordon for you.\n\u0026ldquo;As for us,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Sun said to me, \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s go to the airport to see the plane on the ground, to see whether the landing gear compartment can put a person in addition to the wheels of the plane.\nIn the airport we looked at several models of aircraft, and finally found that those small aircraft landing gear compartment are very compact, closed and closed state is almost no free space, it is difficult to fit a person in. The landing gear compartment of several large aircraft has a lot of spare space, and there are several columns in the landing gear compartment of a certain type of aircraft, so when the landing gear is released, there is no problem for people to hide behind these columns and not fall out. The airport engineer also told us that the aircraft\u0026rsquo;s general flight cruise altitude will be more than 10,000 meters, the temperature will be in the minus tens of degrees, and very low oxygen, air pressure will also become low, landing gear cabin because it is not an airtight space, the engine noise will also be very, very loud, this environment is very difficult to survive.\nThe next day, before going to check the small piece of cloth colleagues brought back a message: the piece of cloth on that incomplete word is the name of a Hungarian airline, while last night from the owner of the furniture city to the discovery of the body this morning in 13 hours, the airport has a total of more than 140 aircraft through the route landing, which really has the airline\u0026rsquo;s aircraft, has gone to track down which one in the end.\nThis, combined with all the clues, explains the whole thing.\nThe deceased entered the landing gear compartment of the plane before she died, and also made \u0026ldquo;careful\u0026rdquo; preparations, covering her head with a plastic bag, earplugs in her ears, and wearing two layers of thicker clothing in the season when the weather was not cold. Although the preparation is meticulous, the material is very simple, just use plastic bags to protect themselves, and do not have any belongings on their bodies, clothing from around the world, presumably a person who may be wandering around the airport, most likely to sneak on the plane and chose to get into the landing gear compartment. But bad luck, chose an international flight, according to the level of corruption shows that he has been dead for at least a week, so it is likely that the first time with the plane has died on takeoff, only because of those few risers stuck to not immediately fall out, until this time may be because the plane bumps to change the position, again open the landing gear compartment to fall down. Unfortunately, because the degree of corruption is very serious, has lost the conditions to identify whether the lack of oxygen or cold and died.\nWhat a great \u0026ldquo;flying corpse\u0026rdquo;!\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/5.pingkongchuxiandeshiti/","summary":"In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed.

The body that appeared out of thin air"},{"content":"Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over. But for those who are still alive behind them, this death is likely to be a lifetime of pain and suffering.\nBeing a forensic scientist is not just about facing corpses, it is also about facing the living. I said in the third \u0026ldquo;Salt Club\u0026rdquo; that\n\u0026ldquo;The doctor-patient relationship is more stable in forensic medicine\u0026rdquo;.\nIn fact, even pathologists who work mainly with cadavers also have to deal with the living - the families of the deceased.\nPersonally, I do not have any special feelings for the corpse itself, most of the time, I just see the corpse in front of me as a very pure object of work, and does not cause any special emotional fluctuations, even those who died tragically, unjustly, and after the death of the body was brutally destroyed, as the object of work, I can maintain a rational and calm mind to face.\nHowever, when confronting the families of the deceased at the crime scene, outside the autopsy room, and after the autopsy, I feel particularly difficult. Almost no family members can calmly accept the death of their loved ones, the scene of mourning will even make me feel that the air around me has become sticky, depressing to the point of breathlessness.\nOr in the year of internship, one day after dinner received a call from the forensic scientist on duty that day, I was quite devastated. I was thinking that a calm day is so beautiful, and then play for a while to wash up and go to bed. The idea itself is a huge Flag, every time will fall without fail.\nThe scene is located in a residential building in the community, from the environment can be seen is a medium to high-end neighborhood. When we arrived at the scene, a friend of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s husband opened the door for us, and after entering the living room, we saw a person lying in front of the bathroom door opposite the door. The husband of the deceased was sitting on the sofa in the living room, in a state of disorientation, his eyes dull, his mouth constantly chanting: \u0026ldquo;Why should I buy! Why did I buy that thing!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I got a call from him at night and he said his wife had committed suicide.\u0026rdquo; The friend who opened the door for us said to us, \u0026ldquo;I told him to hurry up and call the police, I saw him like this when I arrived, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t asked what exactly is going on.\nIt was cruel, but it was important to find out from him what had happened.\nI walked over and sat next to him, took a deep breath, and asked him how he found out his wife was dead. The grieving husband sobbed and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Last night \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; last night when we were both walking around the neighborhood \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; she also assured me \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; that she would not go to the extreme \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; thing, both of us should go on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; well. Today \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; morning I went out to work at 7 o\u0026rsquo;clock, before leaving \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; she also said to wait for me \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; to return in the evening \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; back for dinner! As a result, I \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I came back at 6 pm to see \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; see the house lights on, I called out to her, but no \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; no one \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;promised, I changed my shoes after \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; turning in and saw her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; her hanging in the bathroom door, I rushed over to put \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; put her \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; hold \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; down on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; call the emergency number, I am a doctor myself, I know \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; there was no hope, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept it. I just bought \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; bought that equipment the day before yesterday, I was thinking about good exercise, good life, and she ended up killing herself with this!!! I should not have bought it! If I hadn\u0026rsquo;t bought it, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been like this!\nAfter listening to his description, I feel very bad, before leaving home in the morning also agreed to dinner together in the evening, the evening back to meet not a hot dinner, but a cold body, who would have to grieve ah. His emotions also infected me, a time in the heart is also blocked.\nBut the heart is uncomfortable, but also to do the work. After understanding to him and his friends, the deceased was diagnosed with depression six months ago, and has been insisting on taking medication. Later to the hospital review, the doctor examined that the control is quite good. Probably because she felt significantly better, this wife decided to give herself off the medication until she finally died.\nAfter taking pictures of the scene to fix it, Forensic Scientist Sun and I went up to examine the body with good gloves. The deceased was lying on the ground in front of the bathroom, wearing a coat outside and a set of pajamas inside. The corpse stiffness has been formed throughout the body, the intensity is very high, the corpse spots are mainly concentrated in the legs, the back also has a little, fingers slightly hard pressure will fade. The whole face was dark red, and there was a silk scarf wrapped around the neck. After taking pictures carefully and removing the silk scarf, a wider constriction groove could be seen from below the chin to both sides in the direction behind the ears, which gradually disappeared behind the ears, and a \u0026ldquo;lifting hollow\u0026rdquo; appeared behind the neck. On the right side of the neck, there is a larger skin indentation relative to the rest of the neck where the silk scarf was knotted. The eyelids were turned over and there were dense hemorrhagic spots on the lid conjunctiva and some small hemorrhagic spots on the face.\nAs mentioned earlier, inferring the time of death is a very important part of pathological forensic work, and this time, because it is not long before death, it should be possible to set the time of death roughly to the level of \u0026ldquo;hours\u0026rdquo; based on the phenomenon of the body and the temperature of the body.\nAfter death, because the metabolism of the body has stopped, it can no longer continue to produce heat to maintain a normal body temperature of about 37 ℃. When the ambient temperature of the corpse is lower than the normal body temperature, the temperature of the corpse will slowly decrease until it is the same as the ambient temperature. This decrease in temperature has a certain regularity, and the way of measuring the corpse temperature is convenient and fast, and the accuracy of its results is more reliable, so the comparison of the corpse temperature and ambient temperature can be used to infer the time of death.\nThe measurement of postmortem temperature is different from the measurement of the body temperature of a living person often using the axillary temperature, the fastest cooling of the body is certainly the body surface, while the internal temperature of the body is usually used to measure the internal temperature of the body because it is less affected by the outside world. Most cases are measured rectal temperature, that is, the use of measuring anal temperature thermometer from the anus inserted into a section, and so the temperature stabilized for observation can be. Can also measure the liver temperature, the liver because closer to the body, the temperature accuracy of the rectal temperature will be higher, but the need to move in the body surface knife cut a small opening, not as convenient as measuring the anal temperature, so the vast majority of cases in practice is to use the measurement of rectal temperature to infer the time of death.\nI took out the thermometer from the box, first looked at the temperature in the room, after measuring the anal temperature and then looked at the temperature of the body than the house a little more than 8 ℃, usually in the spring and autumn season is generally the first 10 hours of death fell roughly 1 ℃ per hour, after the rate of decline will slow down, according to this temperature should be about 8 hours of death, but the stiffness seen in front of the corpse, corpse spots but not like only 8 hours Instead, it was more like close to 12 hours or so.\nAfter listening to my report, Dr. Sun said after some thought: \u0026ldquo;Because this is indoors, the temperature in the room is not very low, and she was still wearing clothes, the temperature may be slower to drop, can not absolutely rely on the temperature. Her husband said he had untied her for more than two hours, and you can see that there are only a little bit of new spots forming on the back, mainly on the legs, plus the intensity of the stiffness, so the time of death is about 11 hours.\nIn this way, the projection forward, it is now more than 7 pm, 11 hours ago, that is, about 8 am she has died. At that time, her husband had just left the house.\nNo more valuable information was found at the scene, and we explained to the husband that he would take his wife back for a simple superficial examination, not an autopsy, without destroying her body, to rule out the possibility that she had been killed by someone else. The husband was muddled, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he listened.\nBack to the autopsy room, the deceased on the autopsy table, the next step is to remove all the clothes of the deceased for examination. But Dr. Sun saw the husband of the deceased also followed in, Dr. Sun went over and explained to him again what we are going to do, and asked him to wait at the door first.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t expect the husband of the deceased to say: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I can understand your approach, I just don\u0026rsquo;t want her to lie alone in such a cold iron bed. I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave her alone in such a cold iron bed,\u0026rdquo; he said, as big tears rolled down his face, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t do it, I\u0026rsquo;ll take her off. I said, while crying and holding my wife on the autopsy table, one by one, I took off my clothes.\nThat was one of the most uncomfortable post-mortem examinations I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. In the past, when faced with abandoned children, brutally murdered girls, and innocent passersby, I had no strong psychological fluctuations, my work was just work. But this time, the emotions of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s family were like a big hand that grabbed my neck, making me feel like a lump in my throat.\nIn the end, nothing suspicious was found at the scene or on the body, and the conventional toxicology tests did not find anything toxic. The family of the deceased did not dispute her death and did not request an autopsy test. After issuing a cremation certificate, the matter is also considered closed.\nAlthough this was not a \u0026ldquo;case\u0026rdquo;, I was particularly impressed by the scene: not by the dead body, but by the emotions of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s husband, who gave me a tremendous shock, the heartfelt grief, sadness and remorse for a long time.\n\u0026ldquo;Once a person dies, a lot of human feelings come out.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/6.sizhedejietuoshengzhedetongku/","summary":"Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over.

Death by hanging is caused by using all or part of one\u0026rsquo;s own weight to compress a rope or other similar object around the neck.\nThe majority of hangings are suicides, or self-hangings, commonly known as \u0026ldquo;hanging\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;hanging\u0026rdquo;. As a \u0026ldquo;star\u0026rdquo; death that often appears in various TV dramas, I believe we are not unfamiliar with hanging, so how exactly does hanging lead to death? And will it \u0026ldquo;spit out a long tongue\u0026rdquo; or not?\nWhy does hanging oneself lead to death?\nMany people will say, it is not simple, strangulation of the neck can not breathe is not dead?\nThis answer is not wrong, but it is not enough! In many people\u0026rsquo;s impression, the reason why hanging can lead to death is because the rope strangulation of the neck leads to \u0026ldquo;can not breathe\u0026rdquo;, can not breathe certainly can lead to death, but there is experimental evidence that the tracheal intubation of animals, in the intubation of the upper neck constriction can still lead to the death of animals. This suggests that even when the trachea is open, constriction of the neck can still lead to death, which means that there are other causes that play an important role in death.\nFor example, compression of the blood vessels in the neck can lead to ischemia of the brain, which in turn causes lack of oxygen to the brain tissue. The most common way to hang yourself in the film and television drama is to use rope-like items from the chin around the back of the neck, in this case, the neck arteries and veins leading to the brain can be completely closed because of compression, the brain\u0026rsquo;s blood supply is interrupted. Because the brain as the highest command of the human body, is very, very sensitive to the lack of oxygen, a very short period of time the lack of oxygen will occur irreversible damage. The sudden fall of the body may also cause cervical vertebrae fracture, resulting in serious damage to the spinal cord of the neck, which may not lead to immediate death, but the destruction of the spinal cord will cause rapid loss of consciousness. There is also compression and stimulation of some important nerves in the neck, which may cause the heartbeat to slow down or even stop because of the nerve reflexes.\nIn quite a few people\u0026rsquo;s perception, hanging is specifically referred to hanging, in fact, not only hanging, standing, squatting, kneeling, sitting, even lying down, lying down can occur hanging. Any position that can result in the consequence of \u0026ldquo;ropes to close the blood vessels and trachea\u0026rdquo; has the possibility of death by hanging.\nIn the constricted body will appear some more characteristic performance, can help the forensic pathologist to determine the cause of death. Such as the neck rope compression will form a constriction groove, which is one of the very important manifestations on the body of the hanged.\nAs in the TV series as the most common a white silk flying up the beam, and then the person hung up, some horror films will give a close-up of a person with his head down and a long tongue. In this type of self-hanging, if a forensic examiner comes after death, there will likely be such findings: the heaviest force on the neck - the deepest constriction groove under the chin, and then gradually shallow from the left and right sides upwards, and finally disappeared behind the ears on both sides. The two ends of the constriction groove here do not intersect at the back of the neck, and the constriction groove in the neck is a \u0026ldquo;U\u0026rdquo; shape instead of an \u0026ldquo;O\u0026rdquo; shape, and this phenomenon of non-intersection is called \u0026ldquo;tikong\u0026rdquo;, which was also called \u0026ldquo;eight characters not intersecting\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;not circumference item\u0026rdquo; in ancient times.\nIn addition to the most prominent constriction groove on the neck, the constricted corpse may also show some manifestations such as dark red color of unconsolidated blood, bruised internal organs, small dots of bleeding on the face, under the eyelids and on the surface of some internal organs.\nIn addition, in the typical death by hanging described above, because the blood vessels in the neck are basically pressed shut, the face may be pale, commonly known as \u0026ldquo;white death by hanging\u0026rdquo;; while in other forms of self-hanging, when only the veins closer to the body surface are pressed shut, while the deeper arteries are still supplying blood to the brain normally, this may lead to the accumulation of more and more blood in the head, and finally the bruising of the face, manifesting as The face is dark red or even blue-purple, commonly known as \u0026ldquo;green constriction\u0026rdquo;.\nIt should be noted that these characteristics are only possible, but not certain, in the case of death by constriction. The presence of these manifestations only suggests the possibility of death by hanging, but not absolute certainty that it is death by hanging. They are not unique to hanging, nor are they necessarily present in hanging, so they cannot be used as an absolute criterion for judging hanging.\nAnd about the \u0026ldquo;long tongue of the hanged ghost\u0026rdquo;.\nSome novels or horror movies often depict \u0026ldquo;hanging ghosts\u0026rdquo; as having a long tongue trailing out of their mouths, and some people have asked the question on Zhihu: \u0026ldquo;Do hanging people spit out their tongues? If so, how long can they spit out? Will it be as long as the chest?\u0026rdquo;\nThe answer is: not necessarily spit out, even if spit out, it is far from the distance we put our tongue out of the mouth.\n(Someone must have started sticking their tongue out to see how long it is! Take it back! Beware of catching a cold!)\nMoreover, it is only a relative minority of cases where the tongue is sticking out.\nSo how can we explain the fact that some of the hanged people do show their tongues sticking out of their mouths? When this is encountered during autopsy, it is described in forensic language as a tongue between the teeth, with the tip of the tongue exposed for XX cm. A corpse with such a manifestation would have a high probability that the constriction mark on its neck would be below the thyroid cartilage, which is below the male laryngeal node, a position where pressure would cause the tongue root to be pushed upward, thus giving the tongue the opportunity to stick out of the mouth.\nBut even if this sticks out, the longest is just a few centimeters outside the teeth, the tip of the tongue is certainly not a long hanging out state. This is just film and television works used to create the atmosphere to achieve the purpose of scaring people. Not to mention how after death, is alive, the tongue does not stretch out so long ah, stretching the tongue to follow the basic physiological structure well.\nIf the neck is pressurized parts in the throat above the jaw connected to the neck position, basically the tongue is at most the top of the teeth: tongue against the teeth and not out.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/7.ziyishiruhedaozhisiwangde/","summary":"In the above case, the deceased died by hanging himself in this way.

But when I actually watched a surveillance video of a self-hanging, the cold descriptions turned into vivid images, and I realized that I had overestimated my mental capacity.\nIt was a winter Friday, and I was already planning where to go for the next weekend (note! Flag up). I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to get a call from the leader when I was about to eat lunch, informing that there was a site for me to go with Dr. Sun Forensics to take a look. At that time, I was just secretly mourning for my weekend: my Flag how so indisputable, never established but half a day time. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even realize how much of a shock I was going to get on that very day.\nA father who lived with his son and daughter-in-law came back from shopping with his daughter-in-law in the evening and found his son hanging from the balcony in a well-known upscale neighborhood in B City. He rushed over to put his son down and rushed to contact an ambulance. An ambulance from a nearby hospital soon arrived, however the young son had already lost his life.\nWe arrived at the scene to see a male body lying in the balcony, some medical supplies used in resuscitation were scattered around, there was nothing special on the body, all kinds of typical self-hanging manifestations were present: the face was bruised and swollen, there were dense pinpoint-like bleeding spots under the lid conjunctiva, the neck was a typical constriction mark, there was a lifting hollow behind the neck, and there were no other injuries on the body surface. The scene investigation also ruled out the possibility of a fight with other people. In fact, it is a quite simple, quite ordinary death by hanging.\nBut the father of the deceased is extremely incomprehensible to his son\u0026rsquo;s death, originally because the investigation scene has let him first to the door and so on, but emotional he rushed in. He repeatedly stressed that he wanted to go to the supermarket with his son and daughter-in-law after dinner in the evening, and the son said there was work, he went out with his daughter-in-law, and when he went out, his son also sent to the door, and found nothing unusual at all. He insisted that someone must have killed his son first, and then hanged up disguised as his own suicide. Dr. Sun explained to him patiently, but the old father was particularly emotional, no matter how he could not understand, and also very dissatisfied with our explanation, that we are not responsible for the work, not serious, and insisted that we must find the \u0026ldquo;killer\u0026rdquo; of his son\u0026rsquo;s death.\nI feel a little annoyed in the face of such a scene, Sun forensic doctor is still patiently and carefully explained to the emotional old father, around the same performance constantly changing the angle and method of explanation. I could not listen any longer and started to look around the house.\nThis is a high-end neighborhood, from the home decoration can also be seen, the family\u0026rsquo;s economic conditions are quite good. I gradually shifted my eyes from the ground to the ceiling, and when I saw a camera in the far corner opposite the balcony, I felt that Forensic Sun could stop explaining.\nI went to the door, found the wife of the deceased, and asked her what this camera in the corner of the living room was for.\nThe wife of the deceased said that because the family\u0026rsquo;s economic conditions are good, there are also a lot of valuables in the house, because of security concerns installed cameras in some corners of the house, this camera on the balcony is to prevent someone from the balcony window. These cameras are usually always on, there is a special device to store the video.\nHearing the wife of the deceased said so, my heart has a bottom, walked back into the house, Sun forensic doctor is still doing work with the old father, listen to the voice has obviously anxious mouth, the voice is a little mute.\nI went over and pulled them both, let them all pause for a moment, take them to turn around together to see the camera. Dr. Sun conveyed to me a look of great gratitude.\nHowever, we did not know what a shocking scene awaited us.\nCalled the wife of the deceased also began to study the video surveillance equipment, the good thing is that this equipment is installed when the two couples together to study, but also to save the trouble of finding a technician to use.\nClick on the video recordings of the night, starting from the old father went out to see. The deceased did send his wife and father out the door, turned the door and walked back into the study. The video surveillance in the study shows him walking in and then starting to write something on the computer, because of the angle, you can\u0026rsquo;t see the computer display screen. After half an hour, he answered a phone call, in the process of answering the phone, he seemed to be getting more and more emotional, seemed to shout something into the phone, but unfortunately the set did not record, and do not know what was said.\nHang up the phone the deceased went back to the computer to continue writing, but obviously not as calm as before answering the phone, during which there were several times holding his head and began to drift off. Ten minutes later received another phone call, but this call seems to make him more and more calm. Finally, the dead man who hung up the phone sat in his chair for a while, and then slowly walked out of the study.\nHe slowly paced back and forth in the living room, after walking for nearly half an hour came to the balcony, took down the drying bed sheet to tear off a, climbed to the windowsill to fix one end on the window frame, and then put his head in, feet a crooked hanging in the rope sleeve made of bed sheets.\nJust hang up, his two feet began to kick, two hands also in the direction of the neck, as if to untie the rope around the neck, but just lift up to grab the rope around the neck, his whole body began to twitch violently, two feet straight up and up, the amplitude is getting smaller and smaller, hands also gradually hanging down, and finally feet finally once after hanging down.\nThe whole process of hanging myself was only a few minutes, but I felt like I had spent a few breathless minutes.\nThe hands that wanted to ask for life seemed to pull the necks of everyone present, and the scene was so quiet that even the sound of breathing was inaudible, until the old father\u0026rsquo;s body went limp and fell down.\nThis was the first time I watched a person go from a living human being to a corpse.\nBefore death by asphyxiation there is a spasm of the skeletal muscles of the whole body, from small to generalized ankylosis, which were learned in school, the teacher spoke of the theory, we learned only the bland words.

Hands struggling to survive"},{"content":"After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging? This is not all wrapped around the neck with a rope to let people die?\nIndeed, this kind of rope-like objects wrapped around the neck, through the application of external force, so that the rope-like objects compress the neck death is called strangulation, and hanged very similar. The difference is that the vast majority of strangulation is seen in cases of homicide, used to commit suicide is relatively rare. It is because of the two types of death, one tends to suicide, one tends to homicide, so how to distinguish between the two types of death is also very important for the forensic pathologist.\nAlthough these two ways look similar, but it is because the actual operation is different, it is bound to leave a different performance on the body, these performances may not feel much difference to the layman, but the forensic professional point of view is that there are some worlds apart, especially in the neck this key part, the formation of the two ways alone is not the same injury. In short, the forensic pathologist can distinguish between these two very similar deaths by understanding the case, site investigation, and finally combined with the most important autopsy. It is not so easy to fool the eyes of the forensic pathologist.\nMore than 700 years ago, in the Song Dynasty, the originator of forensic medicine, Song Tzu, dedicated a separate chapter to self-hanging, showing the long history of this form of death and the importance attached to it.\n\u0026ldquo;If you hang yourself under a house, first look at the place where you hanged yourself, and see that there is a lot of dust and dirt on the beams and trusses. If there is no dust at all, it is not self-hanging. First, use the staff to knock gently on the rope tied, if it is tight and straight, it is. If the corpse is moved, it will be moved slowly. If the corpse is moved and hung elsewhere, there will be two marks when the old marks are moved. (From the 1958 Law Publishing House, based on the edition of Sun Xingyan in the twelfth year of the Qing dynasty, \u0026ldquo;The Collection of Injustice\u0026rdquo;, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)\nTranslated into vernacular, it means\nIf one hangs oneself under a beam, one should first examine the beam, lintel, purlin, etc.: if dust rolls down from it in many places, then it is a real self-hanging; if there is only one place where there is no dust, then it is not a self-hanging. If the rope is tight, it is really self-hanging; if the rope is loose, it is the one that moves the corpse. Generally speaking, if the body is moved to another place for hanging, the marks on the neck will change and two constriction marks will appear.\nThis paragraph provides a way to identify the self-hanged or hanged after death, mainly based on the focus of the investigation at the scene to check the location of the hanging dust and rope tightness, or a certain amount of truth. However, these two can only be used as a reference and provide a basis for suspicion, and not as an absolute basis for the final judgment. The performance of the corpse on top of the latter is very useful. Similar to this, where the forensic conclusion must be based on reality, not just rely on theory to explain the problem.\nAs Lord Song said hundreds of years ago: \u0026ldquo;It is advisable to be careful!\nNot only in forensic medicine, but also in the whole system of medicine, there is this common feature.\nThere are no absolutes in medicine.\nAlthough we often say that the human body is a sophisticated machine, but this is only a metaphor, it is absolutely not according to the standardization of the machine to look at the human body, a lot of medical problems are definitely not black and white, one person can appear to be a manifestation does not necessarily mean that others will also be the same. Therefore, for forensic medicine, when making various judgments should be combined with all aspects of information, comprehensive consideration, not rigid thinking.\nFinally, the thoughtful Lord Song also gave a small example.\n\u0026ldquo;There are many people who are women, manpower, or outsiders hang themselves at home, they do not know the law, to avoid seeing the stench and avoid testing, so move the body out of hanging, the old marks move, resulting in two marks. The old marks are purple and red with blood shade, while the mobile marks are only white without blood shade. (From the 1958 Legal Publishing House, based on the Qing dynasty\u0026rsquo;s twelfth year, Sun Xingyan Yuanjian, a proof-text edition of \u0026ldquo;The Collection of Wrongdoing\u0026rdquo;, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)\nTranslated into vernacular, it means\nIn ancient times, it was common for maids and servants to hang themselves at home, but since the master of the house did not know the law, he would secretly move the body outside and hang it up again to avoid the stench of the body and the trouble caused by the official inspection. After this move, the original one rope marks will become two. The original constriction mark of the self-hanging is purple-red with bleeding, and the later moving constriction mark is white without bleeding.\nThis method of judging whether the constriction marks were formed before birth or after death based on the color and the presence of bleeding is very scientific, and in modern forensic medicine, the presence of bleeding at the injury is still one of the important bases for judging whether the injury is \u0026ldquo;before birth or after death\u0026rdquo;. 700 years ago, the ancients already noticed this point, which makes people today marvel.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/9.laizidasongtixingguandeqifa/","summary":"After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging?

,\n01\n\u0026ldquo;A body poured with cement\u0026rdquo;\nThis was Miyoko Kakuta\u0026rsquo;s last case before her arrest, and the one that best demonstrates her ability to charm people.\nAfter looking up a lot of information, I will show you how Miyoko Kakuta destroyed her family step by step, harvested her property, and killed people with a knife.\nAfter sorting out the case information, in addition to lamenting the fragility of human nature, I also had to admit that Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s methods are so high, the criminal psychological complexity.\nThis case is very top, after reading it, I believe you will have a better understanding of human nature.\nThe last victim is the 66-year-old woman mentioned at the beginning, Kazuko Oe.\nAn investigating police officer lamented, \u0026ldquo;If the Oe family, had not met her, perhaps they would have grown old peacefully and happily.\u0026rdquo;\nBut fate is always strange, you can\u0026rsquo;t predict which time and strangers crossed paths, will make their own destruction.\nThe Oe family is a very ordinary working family, a family of six people live on the land under the name of Kazuko Oe, Kazuko Oe is the only old man in the family, the second daughter Yumi and son-in-law Hiroyuki Kawamura have two daughters in elementary school, the eldest daughter Kaede is not yet married, the family life is ordinary and happy.\nIn 2003, the Oe family decided to refurbish the old house for Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s old age, so they built a small three-story building in the name of their son-in-law Kawamura.\n(Oe\u0026rsquo;s family chart)\nOne day in April 2009.\nKawamura, who was going to work on the Hankyu subway as usual, suddenly heard a cry of alarm from the carriage.\nKawamura rushed over and pulled the stuck stroller and the anxious Miyoko out of danger just as the doors were about to close.\n\u0026ldquo;This is a life saver, please be sure to come to my house and I will thank you personally!\nKawamura waved his hand in embarrassment, thinking it was his duty.\nBut Miyoko was very sincere, so Kawamura went to Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s house as a guest, unable to resist the warm invitation.\nAt this time, Kawamura did not realize that this would be the beginning of his future misfortune.\nWith the unique amiability and social skills of an older person, Miyoko and Kawamura then maintained a pleasant relationship.\n\u0026ldquo;It was a big deal to save the baby\u0026rsquo;s life, so I can\u0026rsquo;t thank her enough!\nWith Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasm, Kawamura was invited to her home at least 20 times, and the two of them gradually talked like friends, and Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s work-related matters were gradually revealed to Miyoko.\nMiyoko had a plan in mind.\nOn the grounds that the subway was mismanaged and caused the passenger\u0026rsquo;s baby to be caught, she filed a request for compensation with Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s workplace, Hankyu Subway.\nWith her justifiable reason, and Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s attitude of making a big deal out of it, Kawamura and her supervisor had a big headache.\nThe supervisor agreed to pay 30,000 yen in the name of the company, but Miyoko, who saw the possibility of the matter, immediately used a threatening tone and offered to pay 200,000 yen herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Think it over, or I\u0026rsquo;ll make a scene and let your company executives know!\nThe timid Kawamura wanted to settle the matter and gave Miyoko a promise under the disapproving gaze of her boss.\n\u0026ldquo;I really can\u0026rsquo;t get 200,000, so I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you 180,000 yen and give you 90,000 yen each time.\nLike most people, Kawamura, who just wanted to settle the matter privately, was the perfect prey in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nMiyoko knew that Kawamura would definitely be cold to her if she made such a fuss, so in order to bring her closer, she explained her reasons for doing so to the Kawamura couple at the dinner table under the guise of treating them to dinner.\nThe Kawamura couple also had two daughters, and as they were both parents, they could understand each other\u0026rsquo;s feelings, and the three of them ate happily.\nMiyoko, who had great social skills, used her magic charm and conversation to quickly win the Kawamura couple\u0026rsquo;s favor, and they remained friends for the next eight months.\nBut, it was just the calm before the storm. Miyoko was like a snake, waiting for an opportunity to move and had great patience with her prey.\nThe year-long friendship made the Kawamura couple lose their wariness of Miyoko.\nKawamura also used to go to Miyoko after work to talk, and occasionally would spill his family and workplace grievances to Miyoko, who gently expressed her understanding and enlightened him, while silently calculating in her mind.\n\u0026ldquo;What a poor guy, let\u0026rsquo;s start with him\u0026rdquo;.\nMiyoko then found a suitable opportunity to lend Kawamura 20,000 yen, without mentioning anything about paying him back, and said she would like to invite the Kawamura couple to dinner.\nAfter that, Miyoko and the Kawamura couple often get together on weekends, and Miyoko pays for all the meals, and never mentions AA, so that the Kawamura couple acquiesces that they treat themselves every time.\nIn the process of getting along, Miyoko conquered the Kawamura couple with her personal charm, and her goodwill level was already full.\nSeeing that the time had come, Miyoko started the first round of action.\nShe calculated the meal cost for several meals and determined that the amount was so huge that the other party could not afford it, so she asked the Kawamura couple for the previous loan and AA meal cost, knowing that the other party would not refuse her request because they were embarrassed.\nThe status of the Kawamura couple and Miyoko changed. The guilty Kawamura couple could not get that much money at once, so they had to apologize to Miyoko on their knees in the park, and Miyoko took this opportunity to punch and kick the Kawamura couple, expressing her disappointment in their family.\nShe also persuaded Kawamura to quit his unprofitable job and leave the troublesome family that was asking him to spend money everywhere.\nEven though Miyoko has gone too far, Kawamura and his wife are in the wrong, so they have to swallow their anger.\nWhen Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s idea of opening a cafe comes to her attention, Miyoko promises Kawamura.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead, I\u0026rsquo;ll take care of the land! I\u0026rsquo;ll take care of the land! Don\u0026rsquo;t be a big man and make a decision!\u0026rdquo;\nAs a matter of fact, Kawamura went home and told his wife that he was going to quit his iron job and open a cafe to make a lot of money.\nHis wife thought he was out of his mind and that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t take such a risk with two daughters at home.\nKawamura\u0026rsquo;s relationship with his wife gets worse and worse, and he goes to Miyoko after work to talk about his troubles.\nSeeing that the couple\u0026rsquo;s relationship is hardened, Miyoko seizes this opportunity to further lead Kawamura to resent his family.\n\u0026ldquo;Leave that woman who doesn\u0026rsquo;t support you! You two don\u0026rsquo;t fit! \u0026quot;\nMiyoko was really good at PUA, so she soothed Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s heart with her perfect lover status while fanning the flames for him to quit his job.\nIn April 2010, Kawamura resigned from his 20-year old job and bet the rest of his life on Miyoko.\nThe happy Kawamura must not have thought that his life was about to be ruined by meeting someone unlucky and not knowing people well.\nTo celebrate his departure, Miyoko gave Kawamura a batch of high-class coffee tableware, so Kawamura was full of gratitude.\nOn one side is not understand also complained about your wife, the other side is to support your dream of the perfect lover, if it were you, how would you choose?\nThe answer is obvious.\nKawamura was completely charmed by Miyoko, and he gave her all the 9 million yen from his company\u0026rsquo;s severance package, the millions of yen from his loan, and even the property in his name to open a cafe.\nWith her huge fortune, Miyoko happily moves into Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s house and starts living with Kazuko Oe\u0026rsquo;s family.\nMiyoko\u0026rsquo;s ambition was much more than that, she wanted to squeeze everyone dry!\nSo Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s family-destroying drama, which Miyoko had already succeeded countless times, was staged in Oe\u0026rsquo;s house.\nAfter watching Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s plan, I speculated that she herself must have excellent psychological insight, excellent social skills, know how to interrogate prisoners, and know very well the dark side of human nature, clean and crisp, extremely high psychological quality, as if hammered hundreds of times as skilled.\nThe first step of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s plan: to divest the opponents.\nThe first step is to turn the young couple against each other and pry the family relationship from the children.\nMiyoko was so uncomfortable with her opinionated wife, Yumi, that for over a year, she secretly instilled in Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s two daughters the idea that Yumi was not a good mother, and the daughters, of course, preferred the soft-spoken Miyoko to their strict mother.\nTaking advantage of her lover\u0026rsquo;s advantage, she also kept filling Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s wife with bad words. Miyoko, who had taken the dominant position in the family, called everyone up for a family meeting to discuss the Kawamura couple\u0026rsquo;s divorce.\nThe two daughters, already dissatisfied with their mother, watch the drama while expressing their desire for Miyoko to be the mother.\nMiyoko then forces her wife, Yumi, to give up custody and divorce Kawamura.\nTaking control of the family\u0026rsquo;s finances is like choking a snake by the seventh inch. In order to pacify the meaningless resistance, Miyoko called her cousin Lee Masanori (an accessory, later arrested), who was in his 30s, strong and grew up admiring the Japanese yakuza, to help Miyoko control the family with violence.\nNormally, if the robbery was purely financial, Miyoko, who had already taken the family\u0026rsquo;s property, should have stopped.\nGreed for money is only Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s surface motive, what she really wants is much more than that.\nWhat she wants is an experiment, a sadistic drama called humanity.\nWith the power of the yakuza, the six members of Oe\u0026rsquo;s family no longer dared to resist.\nMiyoko skilfully treats the family like criminals, strictly controlling everyone\u0026rsquo;s diet, work and rest, and even going to the bathroom for up to 16 hours a day requires her consent.\nMentally controlled + violently assisted, almost no one could withstand this double oppression.\nAlthough his wife, Yumi, divorced Kawamura, she was still trapped in the house by Miyoko. His sister, Kaiai, the only one who had contact with the outside world, was blackmailed by Miyoko with her family and had no choice but to turn her back on her fiancé and leave the company.\nSince then, the family has been completely cut off from the outside world and has no income, living only on Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s watch.\nMiyoko uses the experience she has gained in the first half of her life to further deepen the family\u0026rsquo;s conflict.\nThe second step of the plan: the collapse of trust.\nMiyoko begins her experiment with human nature, dismantling the family\u0026rsquo;s seemingly unbreakable bonds of trust.\nDisintegrating love, disintegrating kinship, she seems to be verifying something.\nHow exactly does she turn a family that has lived for over a decade against each other in an instant?\nThe tactics are simple and brutal: if you don\u0026rsquo;t listen, beat, beat until you listen.\nMiyoko asked her wife, Yumi, to abuse her two children in front of the family, and when Yumi did not agree, she was frantically beaten.\nAfter the wife agreed, Miyoko ridiculed the two children for their mother\u0026rsquo;s greed and fear of death, and the two children came to resent their mother even more.\nThe erratic Miyoko suddenly slapped Yumi in a rage, announcing to the family that only she had the right to beat anyone.\nThe family, shocked by Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s extreme character, trembled and did not dare to provoke her anger.\nMiyoko, who knew that the only way to break up the family was from within, encouraged everyone to rat on them, but anyone who was accused would be severely beaten, and for a while everyone was cautiously staring at each other.\nMiyoko knows human nature well, and she wants to subliminally influence the family so that they are completely enslaved and target each other.\nIn April 2011, the first person to be domesticated appeared.\nKawamura, who was already in a recent relationship with Miyoko and had maintained an affair, awakened the violent factor in his body after being disciplined by Miyoko.\nKawamura always believed that he was different in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s mind, and he wanted to prove to Miyoko that he was trustworthy.\nThe family under strict guard is beaten up even when they doze off. Miyoko finds out that her wife has secretly hidden a piece of chocolate and angrily beats her up. When Kawamura sees this, he joins in the beating to show his loyalty.\nPunch after punch was thrown at his wife, shouting.\n\u0026ldquo;Hiromi, just die trying to resist! Listen to Miyoko!\u0026rdquo;\nMiyoko was fanning the flames.\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t do that, use your strength!\u0026rdquo;\nKawamura beat his wife even harder, shattering her expectations, and the bond between them was gone.\nKawamura, who has become Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s right-hand man, has changed from being the ward of the family to being the ward of the family.\nThe family\u0026rsquo;s initial determination to secretly plan resistance and the relationship of trust with each other gradually disappears.\nIf there was any possibility of resistance in the family before, it has now become Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s plaything.\nThe most brutal part of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s character was completely exposed.\nThe third step of the plan: slavery stimulation.\nThe Oe family, who had been abused for a long time, gradually developed a Stockholm mentality. Miyoko saw the beginnings and made her violent control even harsher, knowing that she was close to success.\nMiyoko began to make everyone reflect on their mistakes by writing them down and reading them to them in violent detention, and then putting them in a small dark room where they were beaten with a special \u0026ldquo;punishment stick\u0026rdquo; that left them bloodied and disfigured. In addition, Miyoko degrades their self-esteem, bringing the Oe family to the brink of a nervous breakdown.\nMiyoko was so satisfied that the pleasure of controlling people\u0026rsquo;s personalities was the greatest pleasure she had gained in the first half of her life.\nJust 2 years after Miyoko came into contact with the Oe family, she had complete control over the family.\nIn July 2011, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s desire grew, and she also wanted to get ownership of the Oe family\u0026rsquo;s land, which was owned by Kazuko Oe, who was in her 60s.\nSo she tested Oe and Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s obedience and asked her to jump voluntarily, only to have Oe and Kazuko refuse.\nThis was not just a self-preserving refusal, but a humiliation of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s brilliant record, and from then on, Kazuko Oe became the target of a family group fight under Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s targeting.\nMiyoko\u0026rsquo;s supervision of Kazuko became even stricter.\nShe could only eat two meals a day, go to the toilet twice a day, and from mid-August, she drank less than 500cc of water a day, and even sleeping was restricted.\nWhenever Kazuko did not comply, she was beaten by Kawamura, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s right hand man and former son-in-law.\nUnder Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s control, the family gradually developed a pyramid structure, with Miyoko, who had the highest power, at the top of the hierarchy.\nBelow Miyoko is her son-in-law Kawamura, who is subservient to her orders, further down is her wife Yumi and sister Kaede, and at the bottom is her elderly mother Kazuko Oe, all of whom have the right to beat Kazuko Oe to protect themselves.\nThe Japanese houses were not very well insulated, and the neighbors heard the screams and called the police several times, but they were never taken seriously by the police.\nThe elderly mother, Kazuko, simply could not withstand the constant abuse, and the family\u0026rsquo;s first victim was born.\nIn the summer of 2011, at 9:00 pm.\nThe family punched and kicked Kazuko in a nearby park, a beating named by Miyoko: the family\u0026rsquo;s vent. The beating had been going on for 20 minutes until neighbors around the area saw it and called the police, who arrived.\nThe most brilliant thing about Miyoko is that she knows that the way to make the family completely cut off the idea of calling the police is to get blood on everyone\u0026rsquo;s hands and become a grasshopper on a rope.\nShe wanted to use the family\u0026rsquo;s hands to kill the disobedient Kazuko.\nOn September 11, 2011, under Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s instructions, the family of four beat the sleeping Kazuko again, and the 66-year-old Kazuko Oe was beaten to death alive by her daughters.\nAfter Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s death, Miyoko decided to fake it as a suicide and had Kawamura write the family\u0026rsquo;s suicide note, leaving all the land, property and house to Miyoko.\nMiyoko is also very experienced in handling corpses, and the first thing she does is soak the dead Kazuko in ice water in the bathtub of her apartment.\nAnd immediately ordered Kawamura to buy iron barrels and fill the bodies with cement to abandon them in the abandoned warehouse.\nEveryone is the murderer who killed Kazuko with their own hands, no one can escape and no one will call the police, which completely reassures Miyoko.\nHer sister Kaiai holds guilt over her mother\u0026rsquo;s death, which also annoys Miyoko.\nKaiai took Kazuko\u0026rsquo;s place and was targeted by the whole family.\nOn October 30, 2011, Kawamura and Miyoko tied up and imprisoned Ka Ai in a car near their apartment, leaving her to fend for herself.\nKao-ai, who was lucky enough to escape, fled to Osaka alone and gradually resumed her normal life in anonymity.\nSeeing this, do you think that Kaede really escaped?\nThe answer is no, Miyoko never let go of any opportunity to exploit a loophole.\nAfter Kaede escaped, she immediately ran to the police station to report the crime, crying and saying.\n\u0026ldquo;My important family member is missing, please inform me as soon as the police have any information!\nUnaware of this, the police informed Miyoko that Kaiai had changed her driver\u0026rsquo;s license in Osaka.\nThis time, Kao-ai, who was captured and brought home, never escaped alive.\nKawamura threw Kaiai\u0026rsquo;s body into the sea and was caught by the police as a result, after which Miyoko and the family were all arrested.\nBecause of the long-term dietary restrictions, his wife, Yumi, was on the verge of starvation when she was arrested, weighing only 70 pounds, and Kawamura\u0026rsquo;s weight had also plummeted by 70 pounds.\nEven though the evidence was overwhelming, Kawamura claimed his innocence at the trial on the grounds that he had lost his mind through Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s confusion, but there were signs that he always had a clear head.\nThe police and the judge, both became curious about Miyoko, who possessed incredible criminal abilities.\nUnfortunately, after her arrest, Miyoko committed suicide in the detention center.\n(Miyoko Kakuta, 64, at the time of her arrest) The investigator asked the family what they thought of Miyoko.\nKawamura said that although Miyoko had ruined his family, she had been more kind to him.\nKaiai, on the other hand, did not want to judge Miyoko at all, but rather regretted that she had beaten her mother.\nIt seems that even after Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s arrest, the family could not free themselves from the dominated spirit and even fell into a certain worship of Miyoko.\nThe Oe family, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s last case in her 25 years of work, is a mind-boggling but interlocking case, skilful and masterful.\nAfter looking up a lot of information, I found that Miyoko was just an ordinary woman in the early days.\nHow did Miyoko master these abilities and become a top murderer who \u0026ldquo;manipulates human nature\u0026rdquo; step by step?\n02\n\u0026ldquo;Miyoko Kakuta with a mysterious charm\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is the origin of this mysteriously attractive Miyoko Kakuta?\nLooking at her early life, we can see how a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer was formed step by step.\nIn 1948, Miyoko and her younger sister Mieko were born in Amagasaki City into an unhappy family with parents who often quarreled and a father who was a very powerful local contractor.\nAround the 1960s, many Japanese manual laborers came to Amagasaki to work, and her father let the workers live in his house, taking 40% of their hard-earned money and sometimes providing them with alcohol, and using \u0026ldquo;whips and sugar\u0026rdquo; to train them to be \u0026ldquo;obedient. The \u0026ldquo;whip and sugar\u0026rdquo; is used to train the workers to be \u0026ldquo;obedient\u0026rdquo;.\nFrom her childhood experience, Miyoko realized that people could be manipulated.\nWhen her parents decided to divorce when she was in middle school, Miyoko and her younger sister had to move from one parent to the other, living in a state of uncertainty.\nHer parents\u0026rsquo; indifferent family atmosphere accompanied her throughout her teenage years and planted the seed of distrust in her heart.\nAt that time, she was in the rebellious stage, and rebellious girls always seem to want to prove something.\nAfter graduating from junior high school, Miyoko, who wanted to live like an adult, moved in with her ex-husband.\nOn April 10, 1972, at the age of 23, Miyoko and her ex-husband registered their marriage and devoted themselves to being a housewife.\nAt that time, she, like millions of ordinary women, lived an ordinary life and took care of her family after marriage, but she also had her own insistence that she was determined not to have children.\nSuch a woman, what do you think she should be characterized?\nMy ex-husband, who lived together for 10 years, said Miyoko was just a very timid woman who would cry and cry when she got angry.\n\u0026ldquo;One time when I got separated from the subway at Kyobashi station, she cried and waited for me on the platform because she was afraid of getting lost.\nMy ex-husband couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that this timid woman would become the murderer of a major crime that shocked Japan.\nWhat made Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s amazing change was this next experience.\nMarriage didn\u0026rsquo;t really give Miyoko what she wanted \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nJust 2 years later, Miyoko, divorced from her ex-husband, actually opened an erotic bar on her own and was introduced to people offering exciting special services.\nThe bar was so mixed that Miyoko became acquainted with the local yakuza group and was covered as long as she paid protection money.\nHer friends in the yakuza gave her great peace of mind, and Miyoko was the first to call someone to deal with any trouble in the store.\nMore and more customers were put to rest, and the thrill of bringing people to their knees through violence made Miyoko revel in it. The long time contact with the yakuza allowed her to secretly learn the yakuza tactics of suppressing people and using violence to break down resistance.\nAs the owner of a porn bar, Miyoko also gradually learned the skills of charming men. After understanding the psychology of men, she became more and more sophisticated in her social skills.\nMiyoko\u0026rsquo;s life became more and more regular, and she played the video game \u0026ldquo;Kinko\u0026rsquo;s Palace\u0026rdquo; during the day and went to bars with her yakuza friends at night, so no one dared to mess with her.\nIn the area of Amagasaki Hangase, the \u0026ldquo;not to be messed with\u0026rdquo; Miyoko gradually became more and more famous, and some people even asked her to come out to settle some disputes in the neighborhood.\nThis life lasted for 15 years, and when Miyoko was 40 years old, she closed the porn bar for unknown reasons.\nAfter reading a lot of information, I analyzed that Miyoko joined the yakuza because she found out that the yakuza made money quickly and did not have to pretend with customers and enjoyed a high status, so she joined the yakuza.\nIn the years after closing the porn bar, Miyoko evaporated as if she had disappeared, and no one knew exactly where she had gone before that until she did her first crime and began her plan to take over.\nIt was only after her arrest and imprisonment that Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s true appearance, at the age of 64, gradually became known to us from the lips of her cellmates.\nThe woman who lived with Miyoko for two weeks in shared custody said she had a complicated personality.\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes she cries at night, talks to herself, and is an unpredictable person.\nWhen a prisoner was later brought in for the murder of her own son, Miyoko reminded her that\n\u0026ldquo;That woman is out of her mind, she even killed her own son, don\u0026rsquo;t talk to her, be careful.\nWith her normal outlook and unexpectedly warm heart, Miyoko is able to be a good friend to the inmates in the same room, given the huge contrast of the \u0026ldquo;tragic case of the extermination of the family\u0026rdquo;.\nPerhaps it was the years of running a porn bar that helped Miyoko master the skill of getting close to people quickly.\nWhat kind of person is Miyoko Kakuta? And what is her inner thoughts like?\nAfter field research, Kaoru Takamura, one of Japan\u0026rsquo;s top three speculative writers, believes that Miyoko has the shadow of an ordinary woman\u0026rsquo;s loneliness, an emotion that a murderer should not have, so Miyoko forces herself to strip away this emotion and becomes numb to everything.\nFrom her first days as a porn bar owner to her suicide in detention, Miyoko was always sober, she had a clear goal, knew what she wanted, and didn\u0026rsquo;t care about morality, law or even humanity, there was a negative and pessimistic side to her character from the beginning to the end.\nAfter her arrest, Miyoko repeatedly complained to the prison guards.\n\u0026ldquo;There is no point in living anymore, I want to kill myself, when can I die?\nFinally, on the eve of her trial, she hanged herself in the detention center with a rope made of futon and clothes, leaving everything for posterity to guess.\nHow did Miyoko Kakuta use her powers to become a \u0026ldquo;serial manipulative killer\u0026rdquo; that would leave the world in awe?\n03\n\u0026ldquo;The Hashimoto Family Test Site\nThe Hashimoto family was Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s first family to test the waters, and it was also the first \u0026ldquo;murder case\u0026rdquo;.\nAt that time, Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s methods were still very young, and it took her a lot of effort just to find a reason to invade the family relationship.\nThrough this case, we may be able to find a glimpse of Miyoko Kakuta\u0026rsquo;s early days.\nHow did the Hashimoto family come to be targeted by Miyoko? It starts with Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s own sister, Mieko.\nIn 1981, Mieko used some kind of trick to charm the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s eldest son and moved in with the Hashimoto family, while Miyoko was running a porn bar in Amagasaki City at the same time.\nIn 2001, Mieko married the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s eldest son, and Miyoko became a relative of the Hashimoto family, by which time Miyoko had closed the porn bar and joined a yakuza organization.\nThis tragedy of the Hashimoto family was planned by Miyoko together with her sister Mieko.\nBecause the Hashimoto family was small, just a family of three, it was very well controlled.\nIn 2005, Mieko and her husband climbed a mountain, and while taking pictures, kept making her husband back up and fall off a cliff, and Mieko subsequently received a huge insurance payout.\nThe sisters felt that it was not enough, and Miyoko wanted to drain the Hashimoto family of their assets, so the plan began.\nOnce the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s oldest son died, the family was left with their 71-year-old mother and 54-year-old second son. The sisters violently watched over the two and abused them for six full years, during which Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s brother dated and killed the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s elderly mother, and in 2011 the Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s only living second son was also abused and killed, and the sisters put the remains in an oil drum to destroy the body.\nBecause of the age and lack of records, the case was not filed by the police and has remained hidden until now.\nMiyoko inherited the entire Hashimoto family\u0026rsquo;s estate, and perhaps because the crime went so smoothly that even the police were unable to detect it, Miyoko felt a great sense of validation and learned from her sister Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s experience and prepared to commit the crime alone.\n04\n\u0026ldquo;A funeral that draws fire\u0026rdquo;\nWith the successful experience of the Hashimoto family, Miyoko felt that the matter of destroying the family and taking over the property was very feasible.\nShe begins to optimize her process and hone her PUA skills one family at a time. In the next two cases, Miyoko learns how to break up trust relationships from within the family, and she gradually masters the ability to destroy large families.\nThe unfortunate Kadokawa family and the Yokogi family become Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s practice tools.\nThese two families are huge, and both are related to Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s family by marriage, making them natural fertilizers in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nAt first, Ms. Haru, an aunt of the Kadokawa family, married into the Kakuta family and became Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eldest mother, but later divorced and returned to live with the Kadokawa family until her illness and death.\nAt Ms. Haru\u0026rsquo;s funeral, Miyoko comes uninvited and expresses her dissatisfaction to the Kadokawa family on the grounds that Ms. Haru\u0026rsquo;s funeral was too modest.\nMiyoko shouted: \u0026ldquo;A woman who marries a Kakuda family is a Kakuda family member,\u0026rdquo; which made everyone present afraid to make a sound.\nAt the funeral, there were not only people from the Kadokawa family, but also the Yokochi family.\nCounting up, the Yokodi family was the in-laws of the Menshe family, because Ms. Haru\u0026rsquo;s sister, Ms. Natsu, was married to the Yokodi family.\nThe dozen or so people present were then subdued by Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s boldness, and Miyoko, while pounding on the table, sharply counted the misdeeds of both families.\n\u0026ldquo;Haru is the one who married into our Kakuta family! She will be buried with my uncle, what are you going to do with the money for the funeral and the ashes?\u0026rdquo;\nThe two families had never met such a rude person before, and the funeral was indeed rather simple, so they looked at each other and didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do.\nMiyoko observed the reaction of the two families and continued her pressure.\nIn the following days, she gathered the two families together and called the juniors, the daughters-in-law, over for a family meeting.\nAt the meeting, Miyoko seemed to be looking for a breakthrough. At this time, Miyoko was still in an unskilled stage in sowing discord.\nShe discovers that her children are unwilling to support Ms. Ha, and that there is natural infighting between the two families.\nMiyoko was so happy that she knew Ms. Ha\u0026rsquo;s son could not repay a loan shark, so she promised to help him deal with his debts and used her financial strength to gain a voice in both families.\nThose years in the yakuza taught Miyoko the truth: first let others owe her, she can pry a bigger cake.\nSo Miyoko, who had settled the loan sharks, began to extort money from the two families frequently, and according to the investigation, in just two years, Miyoko pocketed all the property.\nThis is the end of the story, right?\nBut then, Ms. Xia\u0026rsquo;s third son couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford to pay back the money Miyoko lent him to repay the loan sharks and ran away.\nMiyoko was still worried about how to find the next breakthrough, and with this incident, she morally suppressed the two families.\nShe began to try to apply the same kind of regulatory tactics from the yakuza to the family.\nThe yakuza are good at interrogation, destroying a person\u0026rsquo;s willpower with various forms of violence, and Miyoko has learned these techniques to a tee.\nWhile violently guarding and interrogating the two families, she picked two of the younger ones to adopt as her sons.\nThe neighbors reported the case several times, but the police rejected it on the grounds that \u0026ldquo;internal family conflicts are not dealt with\u0026rdquo;.\nThe two poor families were torn apart by the endless abuse.\nIn 1999, Ms. Xia was tortured to death by her three sons, and Miyoko was already very skilled in the art of murder by knife.\nTakeshi Kadokoro gathered the courage to turn himself in at the police station, but the witnesses were too afraid of Miyoko to come forward, and the family was too afraid to confess because of their involvement in Ms. Natsu\u0026rsquo;s murder, and the last report, which ended in failure, was made.\nOnce again, Miyoko easily escaped the law. Having killed two people in a row without being convicted, Miyoko became more and more satisfied with her abilities.\nHer inflated self-confidence made the crime more and more rampant.\n\u0026ldquo;Which family should I start with next? Let\u0026rsquo;s do something more exciting!\u0026rdquo;\n05\n\u0026ldquo;An exciting blood slaughter\u0026rdquo;\nAfter destroying three families in a row, Miyoko slowly found the knack to evolve into a skilled murderer.\nShe knows very well that the families she can directly or indirectly hook up with are the best dishes to be harvested.\nTaking advantage of the weaknesses of human society and following the trail, she could always find the next family.\nSo she targeted her ex-husband\u0026rsquo;s circle of friends, using the natural goodwill of relatives to get close to each other.\nMiyoko went from picking the family to penetrating the inner circle with increasing speed and a steady and precise entry point.\nThe Kaikichi family would never have imagined that an ordinary exchange of pleasantries would become an invitation to death.\nThe Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s eldest son and Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s ex-husband were alumni from high school, and Miyoko quickly climbed into conversation with the other.\nIn 2001, the two met and kept in touch.\nIn 2002, Miyoko began to visit the Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s home several times.\nRemember at the beginning when we introduced Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s experience of opening a porn bar?\nMiyoko used her old ability to seduce men in this hunt. She was so skilled in her business that she charmed the Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s eldest son and invited the Kaikichi\u0026rsquo;s eldest and second sons to come and live in her apartment together.\nIt is worth mentioning that this apartment of hers was originally the property of the Hashimoto family.\nAfter 11 months of living together, Miyoshi\u0026rsquo;s eldest son was compelled by Miyoko to quit his job and Miyoko began to reveal her true nature.\nThe two brothers who came to their senses succeeded in escaping in 2007 and changed their names to begin a long life on the run.\nWith Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s character, the rest of the Kaikichi family could not be spared.\nIn 2003, the 87-year-old mother of the Kaikichi family, who stayed at home, was taken by Miyoko to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, where she was imprisoned and abused to death, and her remains were buried near the Tanimoto family home in Takamatsu City.\nThe strange thing is.\nMiyoko never did anything meaningless, so why did she have to take an 87-year-old man all the way to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, which is very far away?\nAfter combing through a large number of cases, I found that Miyoko was becoming more and more skillful in manipulating her family, not only destroying families at a faster pace, but also maturing in her methods and abilities.\nShe even started a two-pronged plan to destroy the next family in the process of \u0026ldquo;finishing\u0026rdquo; the last one.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s right, Miyoko is imprisoning the Kaikichi family while looking for her next family.\nShe is no longer satisfied with eating the grass on the edge, she wants to verify something bigger.\nThe unfortunate Tanimoto family is the first \u0026ldquo;stranger\u0026rdquo; family Miyoko tries.\nThe Tanimoto family was Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s penultimate crime before she was caught, marking the full maturity of Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s methods.\nIt was scalable, batchable, and so efficient that the process was already fixed.\nThe Tanimoto family and the Oe family mentioned at the beginning are very ordinary, ordinary people, and Miyoko can be considered strangers.\nHow to bring down a strange family? After thinking about it day and night, Miyoko cut into the family as a friend.\nThe kind and happy Tanimoto family of four could not have imagined that the family would be completely destroyed by this old woman whom they knew from one side.\nThe police information on the Tanimoto family murder is not comprehensive, after reviewing a lot of information, I will restore the most critical part of the case.\nMr. Tanimoto and his wife, Mrs. Hatsushiro, had two daughters, Jasmine, the eldest, and Rukia, the youngest.\nNo one could have imagined that years later, the younger daughter Rukia would become the murderer of her sister Jasmineko.\nNot only did Rukia recognize Miyoko as her mother and obey her, but she also married Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s adopted son and became a complete accomplice.\n(The four members of the Tanimoto family, left sister Rukia and right sister Jasako) In 2003, Miyoko frequently visited the Tanimoto family in Takamatsu City as a friend. In the morning, she was laughing and joking with the Tanimoto family, but in the afternoon, she went to the house in Takamatsu City to abuse the elderly mother of the Kaikichi family.\nWith the fat of the Tanimoto family, Miyoko was not slow to give the Kaikichi family to wrap up the disposal of their property and destroy the body.\nFrom controlling the family to completely appropriating the Tanimoto family\u0026rsquo;s property, this time, Miyoko took less than half a year.\nShe brought 10 socialites to the Tanimoto family and stayed there for half a year, violently driving the Tanimoto family to live on the second floor to prevent them from escaping and putting the yakuza on duty in shifts every day.\nLocking the defenseless women in the hut, they inflicted violence while mentally pressuring them with.\n\u0026ldquo;You should know exactly what you are, you are a disgrace to society!\u0026rdquo;\nShe made the family members write down bad things about each other, mastered the conflicts between each of them, called the younger ones out to talk alone, instilled bad things about the elders, and forced them to be loyal to herself.\nThe family then became a scene of holding each other back and targeting each other, and Miyoko established a new order without having to watch over it herself.\nEvery morning the Tanimoto family was forced to produce 200,000 yen in cash, and in just six months Miyoko took more than 20 million yen (equivalent to about 1.2 million yuan).\nShe made the family kill each other, taking the younger generation as hostages to threaten the elders to obey, and everyone was unable to resist.\nIn contrast, her sister Jasmineko was personally strong-willed and was not brainwashed by Miyoko.\nMr. Tanimoto realizes that there is only one chance to ask for help with this tight control of Miyoko! He found the right moment to pretend to quarrel with his wife, Ms. Hatsushiro, and took advantage of the chaos to let Jasako escape. The confused Jasako was ready to go to take the train to leave the city, but the train required identity registration and was arrested back by Miyoko on the grounds that her family was running amok.\nHer sister, Jasmine, is not at all obedient, so Miyoko has her sister, Rukia, who has been completely brainwashed, take her to her apartment in Amagasaki City and imprison her, where Rukia recognizes Miyoko as her mother and marries Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s son, becoming a member of the Kakuta family.\nRukia abused Jasako more and more, burning herself with a firearm and burning herself with a cigarette was a common occurrence.\nThe neighbors had called the police as many as 36 times, and like the victims of other cases, the police refused to investigate on the grounds that the case could not be filed if not reported by the victim herself.\nLike Kaiai Oe, Jasako was surprisingly lucky to escape, and she moved to Osaka to live her life anonymously and anew, unwilling to call the police because of her own involvement in the abuse of her family.\nJasako\u0026rsquo;s quiet life lasted for 2 years and 11 months.\nDecember 2006.\nAlso for the reason of changing her driver\u0026rsquo;s license, the police informed Miyoko of Jasako\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts. Jasako was once again taken back by her sister who had come a long way and was brutally abused to death, and her mother, Ms. Hatsushiro, was also abused to death by her sister in her old home.\nAfter appropriating all of the Tanimoto family\u0026rsquo;s property and stealing a daughter as a family member and killing Tanimoto\u0026rsquo;s wife and eldest daughter, Miyoko was completely satisfied to call it quits.\nDuring the same year, Miyoko set her sights on the unrelated Oe family \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nAfter sorting through all the cases, I realized that Miyoko did not start off with such a perfect crime.\nShe had periods of trial and error, but because she firmly grasped the psychology of the murdered families, exploited the loopholes in the police and the law, got away with it again and again, and refined her criminal techniques to perfection, she was able to create seven tragic cases that spanned 25 years.\nBehind the seven cases, Miyoko also has something different from ordinary serial killers.\nShe clearly came for her fortune, but then she forced the families, who were drained of their economic value, to die one by one.\nIt seems to be some kind of pleasure for her to break the superficial harmony between human beings, and to see the family members being suspicious of each other may be one of her motives for committing the crime.\nWhat kind of mood did Miyoko have to commit her crime?\nWhat was her real motive? With Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s suicide after her arrest, there is no way to know.\n06\n\u0026quot; The Final Trial and the End \u0026quot;\nOn September 25, 2013, the last case opened in Kobe.\nThe 25-year-long \u0026ldquo;Idea Serial Murder Case\u0026rdquo;, in which at least seven families were completely destroyed, finally came to an end.\nAll the members of the family who were directly or indirectly involved in the killings were convicted to varying degrees.\nThe Kagawa Prefectural Police Department, which ignored 36 calls from the murdered families, publicly admitted its inadequacy, and as the case shocked Japanese society, the Hyogo Prefectural Police and the Kagawa Prefectural Police set up a new department to analyze the inquiries received by each police station.\nJapan has also introduced policies related to disputes between relatives and neighbors.\nThe media have speculated about Miyoko Kakuta\u0026rsquo;s motive for the crime, but it remains foggy.\nRegarding Miyoko as a person, there are some contradictions in her unusual modus operandi and motive that feel reasonable but perverse that deserve attention.\nCombined with criminal psychology and police speculation, most murderers with strange personalities are used to living alone.\nInstead, Miyoko formed an extended family with eight unrelated people throughout the series of cases. From the narrative of the previous cases, we can see that she has an obsession with children and likes to adopt them. And this group of her family members rely on her to make ends meet.\nOn one hand, she is constantly destroying other people\u0026rsquo;s families, and on the other hand, she sets out to build her own family.\nMiyoko seems to keep proving the dark side of human nature and the fragility of love in various cruel ways in different families. This also reinforces her belief in the pessimistic ideas she previously subscribed to.\nEvery time she provoked family relationships, she watched silently. Sometimes with silent tears on the sidelines, other times with a self-deprecating smile.\nFor 25 years, the collapse of every family seemed to start with the provocation of the couple\u0026rsquo;s relationship, and every couple\u0026rsquo;s family was her testing ground. And each couple\u0026rsquo;s relationship eventually, not surprisingly, broke down, with both sides even fist-fighting.\nAs events progress to a later stage, this break-up gradually rises again between the two generations, intensifying. Throughout the spectatorship, Miyoko seems to be watching everything from God\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nCombined with Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s family of origin and early childhood experiences, one cannot help but venture a guess that Miyoko may have been subconsciously reverting to the traumatic experiences of her childhood, to the episodes where her family had a significant impact on her psyche.\nPerhaps she is verifying, trying to repeatedly confirm whether there is a true love that will not break, whether there is a love in the family that can never be provoked?\nOr maybe she is just making herself admit over and over again in a case that really happened, admitting that the pessimism in her own eyes is what the world was supposed to be like \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nPerhaps the world in Miyoko\u0026rsquo;s eyes can be touched with one sentence.\nWhen you get used to pessimism, it can be as pleasant as optimism.\n\u0026ndash; Bennett\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/9gezhijirenxingheianmiandizhenshianjian1/","summary":"If you are an ordinary 64-year-old grandmother, want to effortlessly screw up 7 families, what should you do?\nEat people\u0026rsquo;s money, make the man obsessed with the old and decrepit you and the beautiful wife divorce, even do not even want to work, give you the house property, without your own hands, so that all the people who do not listen to you are killed.\nPretty golden handshake, right?\nIn reality, can it really be done?","title":"Manipulation of the human mind | Japanese intentional murder case: the 64-year-old woman's borrowed knife to kill 10 people"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Murder is sacred\u0026rdquo;: he is the only criminal with the word \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; in his criminal file! Killing is ritualistic!\n\u0026ldquo;Why does everyone tell me that I can\u0026rsquo;t stay longer at the train station?\u0026rdquo; This is a question that many people have asked.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say an answer in my mind: because it is haunted and murderous!\nThis is also a real event that happened many years ago.\nPutting aside the superstition, it is really haunted! This is the only murder case in the country\u0026rsquo;s criminal records that has the word \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; in it.\nHow spooky is it? The ghost came down from the sky and floated away after killing; how cruel and bizarre is the method? Cruel to look at the corpse, the professionals were scared not to speak; bizarre to the local police held a case analysis meeting, but the whole confused!\nAt that time, a train station in Shaanxi once became a forbidden place, so many people stop!\nIf you are interested, I, as a personal experience, will write about what happened at the time, to restore it perfectly.\nBut also a reminder: resistance to stress is small, please stop here, because the next part of the scene, will cause all kinds of discomfort.\nMarch 3, 1994\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with this day. In the early morning after the fog, we were standing in front of some roadbed berm on the northwest side of the train station in the city of Valium.\nEveryone looked bad, no one was talking, and the atmosphere was cold. Only the forensic scientist squatted in front of the body, doing various examinations.\nThis is an elderly male corpse, naked, tied hands, kneeling on the ground, making an atonement-like kowtow.\nHis clothes, all neatly folded aside, but only missing the autumn pants. Because the pants were put on his head.\nObviously, the murderer intended to do it.\nForensics also lifted the pants, but that moment, the people who saw all revolted.\nThe whole face of the deceased was a bit collapsed, especially on the brain shell, it was simply a pit after another pit.\n\u0026ldquo;A total of 11 contusions (blunt force trauma caused by fracture type), each fatal!\u0026rdquo; The coroner said to us.\nThat sounded contradictory. I thought to myself: if each of them could kill a person, why did the killer hit him eleven times? And if the body had been stripped naked, why did he cover his head again?\nAnd the murder scene.\nNot far from the body, there is a burned paper circles. It was drawn with a tree branch.\nMy guess is that after the murder, the killer just burned the paper at the murder scene. But what was the purpose? A sacrifice to someone?\nIn addition, the scene did not leave much blood, which is also directly related to the murder weapon. I guess the murder weapon is a hammer, with this thing to hit the head, to vulgarity, are internal injuries.\nNext to the burned paper circle, in addition to scattered scratched matches, but also distributed a large number and disorderly footprints.\nI looked at them in comparison, not the deceased.\n\u0026ldquo;What did the killer do at that time?\u0026rdquo; I am full of question marks. Incidentally, I observed these footprints, especially focus on picking out a few to try to simulate themselves, to see how can also step out of a similar track.\nFinally, I came up with a ridiculous idea: he was dancing!\nImagine the scene: the hot corpse kneeling here, the killer and a fire with coins, and then, he danced in the firelight!\n2\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce myself. I was a special professional in the nineties - the grey eyes and ears of special cases, which is also the predecessor of 321 (criminal special intelligence).\nThe people who came here know that the era of the big cases and important cases more, the police force is seriously inadequate, and like me a slight skill of the released prisoners, was \u0026ldquo;recruited\u0026rdquo; to become a force like a supporting force.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go back to this case.\nIn the morning, the large conference room of the Public Security Bureau of Stabilization City was filled with smoke.\nThe participants all had serious faces. It is not an exaggeration to say that everyone was confused.\nThis is the second murder case in a row in the last week. The modus operandi was almost identical.\nThe victims were both elderly males. One was 56 years old, one was 52 years old, and both were found with unchecked tickets in their belongings, thus judging that both were passengers. Also no cash was found.\nIn response to the two murders, there are differing views within the police.\nSome people believe that the killer is a pure pervert, the elderly and infirm men as the target, essentially robbing the main; but others believe that this is a typical case of revenge killing, the 11 thwarted trauma, is a manifestation of the abuse of the body to vent their anger.\nOf course, my partner beard and I, once a prison oil (prison head prison bully), and did not participate in the whole meeting. Later, the two of us, with the upper line (detective) Ma Sanshui together to hide in the next room.\nMa Sanshui smoked one cigarette after another.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m scared!\u0026rdquo; He suddenly opened his mouth and came out with this sentence.\nBeard and I looked at each other.\n\u0026ldquo;Brother Shui, you are an old bird who has seen the storm, this case, and only two people died, what is the fear?\u0026rdquo; Beard said, and gave Ma Sanshui a cigarette refill.\nMa Sanshui very serious stare at us both: \u0026ldquo;This has nothing to do with how many people died! In other cases, even if more people died, but as long as the crime scene, I can more or less understand the psychology of the killer, but this time, which of you can tell me, the killer in the end what?\u0026rdquo;\nThe table was originally bashed with a pile of information, all about the dead.\nHe deliberately pushed the information toward us. \u0026ldquo;A revenge killing? The two dead, a stuttering welder, a crippled peddler selling kang buns (sesame cakes), what juxtaposition do they have? As for the robbery, where there are such robbers? Dedicated to robbing the poor, but also burn paper and dance to celebrate?\u0026rdquo;\nThe beard and I did not know how to answer.\nMa Sanshui took a few more puffs of muffled smoke, a change of topic: \u0026ldquo;At present, this is also a serial murder case. This kind of serial cases, there is often a cooling-off period, but the 2nd 28th kill a person, today March 3, another dead. It\u0026rsquo;s too fast! And so far, we don\u0026rsquo;t even have any information about the killer, as it is \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe a sigh.\nBeard seemed to think of something and rubbed his hands, \u0026ldquo;Brother Shui, we may have information on the killer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Ma Sanshui asked.\nBeard mentioned a word: \u0026ldquo;Ghost.\u0026rdquo;\n3\nI understood what the beard meant. More than a month ago, more than one passenger responded that the Anding train station was haunted at night.\nIn fact, in those days, haunted things often, but mainly blackmail.\nThe ghost of the station alone, the police also sent people to investigate, collected information on this, and eventually, according to the information, to make a sketch of it.\nBeard and I have seen. The first feeling, called the ghost is okay, or called the goblin is also okay. Anyway, it is covered with furry.\nBeard even gave it a nickname: Hairy Boy!\nI guess, the beard is to remind Ma Sanshui, the ghost could be the murderer pretending to be it?\nBut then, the mystery is more, the killer impersonated it to do what?\nMa Sanshui heard the beard\u0026rsquo;s reminder, the first reaction was to say back: \u0026ldquo;Bullshit!\u0026rdquo;\nBut he is not like other police officers, not so dead brain.\nWait and silently pondered some more. He ordered: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do this, you two go to verify the matter again. Remember, everything must be based on facts, bite the right!\u0026rdquo;\nNext, while the two of us launched an investigation, the police also had action.\nEspecially according to several discussions and analysis, combined with the scene left shoe prints and other features, the police to the criminals made a \u0026ldquo;profile\u0026rdquo;: male perpetrators, aged 20-35 years old, about 1.7 meters tall, carrying a short-handled masonry hammer, withdrawn and introverted personality, psychological disorders, good alone activities or single living alone. Familiar with the situation of Anding station, in Anding has a fixed residence.\nOf course, at the bottom of this \u0026ldquo;profile\u0026rdquo; description, there is a note: the perpetrator is likely to have only a junior high school education, may also have been dealt with by the public security organs, and economic difficulties, waiting for money.\nI know that \u0026ldquo;profiling\u0026rdquo; is very profound, almost all the criminal investigation professional things. As the eyes and ears, I once tried to backtrack, wondering what the police are based on to reach these conclusions. But finally gave up. The difficulty is too great.\nThe police have been using \u0026ldquo;profiling\u0026rdquo; as a basis, and almost all of them are out there. The police were almost all over the place, centered on the station, and started a search in a three-kilometer radius. I remember when everyone was shouting slogans: task to group, responsibility to the person. Whether in the road, urban, rural, as long as in the lock area, all do not let go.\nFor a while, the beard and I even dare not open the walkie-talkie, because both the main frequency or alternative channels, it is simply a cacophony of people, chaos and a pot of porridge.\nEveryone either asked each other about the progress, or someone reported that he had found the suspect.\nLook at it this way, the beard and I took advantage of a handful, after all, we two are not so strong, just simply to investigate the ghost matter.\nOriginally, I also intended to strictly follow the implementation of what Ma Sanshui said, the ghost incident in the factual basis for the full collection of things over, but in fact, I found that simply can not do.\nA person in the know: the night he rode in the car, he did see a ghost! The ghost fanned its wings, furry and descended from the sky, and after a face-to-face meeting with him, it fanned its wings and flew into the foggy night.\nAnother informant was even more outrageous, he insisted: the ghost appeared in the blink of an eye, and in the blink of an eye, it disappeared without a trace.\nI did not say anything at the time. The bearded man, once anxious, questioned those in the know: \u0026ldquo;Flying into the sky? Suddenly appear and disappear? Damn, your heads are not farted?\u0026rdquo;\nThanks to my mediation, otherwise these people in the know really want to go to Ma Sanshui that a complaint, saying that the beard rude and so on, it is estimated that he will have to be locked up for a few days.\nThis wavered to two days later in the evening, the beard and I returned to the residence.\nWe both ate boxed meals, bearded originally and I chatted, but I tend to slip, the heart still thinking about the case.\n\u0026ldquo;Old Ge, off duty! Relax, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the big girl is good?\u0026rdquo; He interrupted me again this time.\nThen he pointed out the window: \u0026ldquo;You say this foggy day, those big girls are hiding at home why? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they also be thinking about handsome guys?\u0026rdquo;\nMy brain like a sudden electric current, and even a jolt, hands loose, chopsticks are dropped on the floor.\nThe bearded man shushed me: \u0026ldquo;Talking about the big girl, look how excited you are!\u0026rdquo;\nHe was about to help me pick up the chopsticks.\nBut I grabbed his hand.\nHe was startled: \u0026ldquo;What are you doing? Look at your thieving eyes, remind you, I\u0026rsquo;m a man!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Misty! Misty!\u0026rdquo; I was in a hurry, I could only pop out one word at a time.\nSee the beard still look confused, I swallowed hard, and reminded: \u0026ldquo;What happened the night of the two murders?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fog ah!\u0026rdquo; Beard replied.\n\u0026ldquo;Then think again, when we investigate ghosts, those in the know said that the night of the ghosts, what was the weather?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fog! Fog fog!\u0026rdquo; Beard slowed down after half a beat, read aloud and repeatedly, but do not forget that he is still eating. The result caused my face a moment sticky a lot of rice grains.\nI could not care less about this, after wiping casually, also pointed out the window: \u0026ldquo;Tonight there is fog! And big!\u0026rdquo;\n4\nMarch 6, 1994\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know much about geography and meteorology, but in the city of Valium, every late winter/early spring season, there is frequent fog at night.\nThe beard and I discussed some more, and both agreed: the killer likes to be out in the foggy days. Although the specific reason is still unknown, but if we really guessed right, this night will be a focus.\nAt that time there was no cell phone, and even only the models deserve to have a big brother. I in order to report this guess to Ma Sanshui in a timely manner, it continuously paged him (BB), and even gave him a Han Hsien reminder: fog!\nUnfortunately, he never called back.\nI discussed with the beard, so we both went to the train station overnight.\nOnly one purpose: patrol, to prevent further tragedies.\nAlso take into account the night is too cold, we both in addition to wrapped in a thick cotton jacket, also each wearing a dogskin hat.\nThat shape, think about it, even if the more serious people, wearing it, are a bit of a blind man\u0026rsquo;s feeling.\nI remember that the two murders happened between two and four in the morning, so I pinpointed the time, just after two, we both walked back and forth along the platform.\nAlso because we are very tired during the day, and now the night and back-to-back, the beard eventually some can not stay up, once with me spit: \u0026ldquo;Almost have to it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that when we go back, the killer will appear again in time!\u0026rdquo; I said my fears.\n\u0026ldquo;There is no such coincidence!\u0026rdquo; He waved a big hand.\nBut soon, when the two of us out of the station, out of the northwest side of another large, not to mention him, even my eyes widened.\nThere was the firelight! In the night fog, it was hazy, but also very conspicuous.\n\u0026ldquo;Burning, burning paper?\u0026rdquo; Beard chanted.\nI did not answer him positively.\nAt this moment I have a deer in my heart, it crashes around a lot.\nI gestured to the beard, afraid to talk now delay.\nI mean: go to the other of the tracks, under the cover of the slope, we sneak past.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a chore! Because we have to walk the duck walk. That is, the kind of half-crouching walk.\nDo not look at the short distance of one hundred and eighty meters, and finally my crotch shaft are sore, but wait to lie down on the tracks, and then so close to observe, there is indeed someone burning paper, he is also wearing a black trench coat, in addition he is also dancing weird.\nBeard and I are pressed, I deliberately and carefully look for some, no body found.\nSo, he was burning paper and dancing before bringing people here to kill? I thought.\nAfter another ten seconds or so, the beard can not sink.\nThis kid is, after all, the prison oil origin, the hands of no one. He bowed, like a leopard, and so noiselessly stepped over the tracks, he suddenly spring up like a spring and pounced.\nA hungry tiger pounced on him. The man grunted miserably, the face rushed down by the beard sat on the ground.\nI was thinking, how to play next to help themselves? But the beard eeked, then even jumped up, playing a life to escape to my side.\nI completely froze, thinking that in the end what happened?\nBeard came back and pushed me hard, that means, you rushed!\nLooking at the killer immediately stood up, I put aside all distracting thoughts.\nI do not beard that move, so after rushing over, directly flying up a foot.\nThe murderer was kicked by me again lying on the ground.\nI sat on my butt on his back.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t give up and struggled for his life. But I can let him get away with it.\nI grabbed his hair with one hand and stuck the back of his neck with the other, and with a little force, he gasped.\n\u0026ldquo;I, I\u0026rsquo;m a cop!\u0026rdquo; He came out with this sentence.\n\u0026ldquo;You are a police officer? I\u0026rsquo;m still the chief of public security!\u0026rdquo; I increased the force again.\nBut all of a sudden, I reacted to something in general.\nI deliberately turned my head sideways and looked at his face.\nI froze, he also froze.\nAnd at that moment, the beard with an innocent look on his face, came running across from the railway track.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening?\u0026rdquo; He shouted and asked, then looking at the one on the ground, he was even more pretending to be surprised, \u0026ldquo;Brother Shui, why are you here?\u0026rdquo;\n5\nThe three of us sat around and smoked together. In fact, Ma Sanshui is a pretty decent police officer, but now completely changed the image.\nBird\u0026rsquo;s nest head, untidy clothes!\nIn fact, when the two of us helped him up, he once let go of the words: \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what you old Ge did this time, replaced by the beard, I guarantee to jerk his job!\u0026rdquo;\nI glanced at the beard. Beard a strong wink to me.\nNever mind, all brothers, the pot to carry!\nI was also once curious, why he came here in the middle of the night to burn paper. Of course, I would not be stupid to think he is a murderer.\nMa Sanshui explained: he came back from overtime to see my paging, it was also the middle of the night. He thought we were resting, considering that we were both too tired recently, and as a result he came here alone.\nThe reason why he burned paper is that he wanted to take advantage of the foggy day to simulate the phenomenon of the crime at that time, to see if he could capture what psychology of the killer.\nI feel in my heart that he is really a good cop.\nSometimes men don\u0026rsquo;t have to talk much to each other. I patted him on the shoulder.\nOf course, under this pat, and stirred up a burst of dust.\nMa Sanshui\u0026rsquo;s meaning, since we two also came, we will share the work, here continue to work until dawn.\nBeard and I have no problem.\nIn order to be more efficient, the three of us also divided the area. I am mainly responsible for the east side of the train station.\nWe also agreed to make a whistling sound the more we got to the emergency.\nIt sounds primitive, but we did not bring the walkie-talkie, and only the whistling sound, it is the most penetrating.\nWith less beards for company, I found myself on patrol, often becoming bored, accompanied only by the sound of train whistles entering and leaving the station.\nAfter a few more trips back and forth like this aimlessly, I sat down on the ground to rest for a while.\nThe fog was getting thicker and thicker. In addition to the poor visibility, it also made people feel wet and uncomfortable.\nI pinched myself, as a kind of massage and relaxation, but not long, especially the buttocks have not covered warm it, I faintly heard a cry.\nWailing, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada. Very miserable, it seems to be a woman.\nIn the middle of the night, I was so scared that my hair stood up.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is playing a prank?\u0026rdquo; The first thought came to me, and I looked in the direction of the sound coming from.\nAlthough nothing could be seen, but I tasted.\nThen I faintly heard a scream. At this point, even a fool, should also guess what.\nI immediately got up, looking for the sound rushed over. In fact, this moment, I was nervous, but also forgot to send a signal.\nJust a few dozen meters ahead, a black shadow suddenly appeared in front.\nI looked at him through the fog as much as I could, and he was looking at me.\nI felt that the whole heart was in the throat, because I could not tell for a moment, this is a person or a ghost.\nHe was wearing a black robe, estimated to be fur and other materials, so some hairy feeling. In addition, his face is also full of black hair.\nHairy child? I suddenly thought of beard words.\nHe was also carrying a black goo in his hand at the moment, presumably the murder weapon.\nWe both looked at each other in silence for a few seconds, and he tilted his head. I could tell that he was surprised and curious about my appearance.\n\u0026ldquo;What a pervert!\u0026rdquo; I cursed in my heart.\nBut then, without waiting for me to do anything about it, he twisted and scattered to escape.\nReally let him retreat into the thick fog, where else could I catch him?\nI therefore chased up.\nIn fact, my legs and feet can still, after all, once joined the swallow door, as a thief. But the evil, I finally in order to stimulate the potential, are hard to pinch their thighs root, but still with the murderer half a catty a chase and escape.\nThe murderer is different from me, while running along the way while flailing. This description is not all right, but that is the feeling, especially under the amplitude of the hands dancing, more to me a feeling that he was flapping his wings.\nWe both followed the railroad tracks from the east side of the train station and came to the station.\nEventually I vaguely saw that he had gotten into a freight car (fire car) with an open door.\nThere were lights and piles of paper boxes of all sizes, as if a small mountain.\nI knew that the killer was hiding here.\nI wiped the sweat from my head and pulled out my trouser belt.\nI also prepared my mind, once I found him, I strangled him to death.\nBut when I passed several piles of paper boxes in turn, there was no gain at all.\n\u0026ldquo;Hidden deep enough!\u0026rdquo; I spat in my heart.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect was that suddenly there was movement in the pile of paper boxes behind myself.\nThe boxes crackled and fell towards me, and a black shadow rushed out from inside.\nHe swung a short-handled hammer, which came down hard on my head.\nThanks to my quick reaction, I raised the belt of my pants to block a little.\nBut he immediately kicked me again.\nFor a moment, I froze. Because this kick is very strange, let me have a kind of vague feeling.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if I was hallucinating, or was there something else going on? But the kick came down, and I also sat on my butt in a pile of boxes.\nThe killer did not continue to attack me, I guess he was also weak at this point.\nHe fled in a flash and escaped. And this lack of virtue, but also very skilled to push the door of the cargo compartment.\nWith a thud, I knew it was going to be bad. But when I rushed to the door, no matter how hard, the door of the cargo compartment did not move \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nI had to slap the door hard, again to no avail.\nThis is a freight train, at this point also sounded the whistle.\nYou can imagine what my next fate is. I left Valium with the freight car, and started a tragic pattern of day trips abroad \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\n6\nWhen I returned to Valium again, it was already the next day at night.\nThis day, a lot of things happened.\nFirst, a female body was found at the train station. She was over 20 years old, a beautiful-looking pregnant woman, with a fetus of about five months in her belly.\nThe cause of death was 11 blows to the head by the murderer, and a stone hammer to her belly.\nWhat was the scene? The female corpse died on her knees, the head of the fetus actually came out a cut, hanging in the crotch of the female corpse.\nAs for the rest, similar to the previous two murder weapons. In the scene found some scratched matches, the killer also danced, but he did not have time to burn paper, I guess with my then \u0026ldquo;intrusion\u0026rdquo; related to it.\nSecondly, everyone thought I was killed, after all, I somehow disappeared, but also missing in action, the dead.\nAt that time, the number of beards cry the most miserable, he also threatened to say that I would rather be sentenced to death, when the time to avenge the old Ge, after catching the murderer, on the spot he died alive!\nBut his words, but also met with Ma Sanshui severe criticism.\nIt is said that the bearded man hid at home for a day of depression, until I suddenly pushed the door, he only ah.\nI do not care whether I am a human being or a ghost, he froze for a few seconds and then suddenly jumped over, all kinds of hugs! I had to stop it in advance, otherwise he would have been excited to kiss me a few times.\nI did not care to rest, overnight to report their encounters to Ma Sanshui.\nBut just report it, not much help to solve the case.\nThe following week, the killer disappeared without a trace. During this week, the train station twice again under the fog, the police also sent a large number of people, to come here to squat, but in vain.\nIn addition, because of the seriousness of the three murders, the matter completely alarmed the upper echelons, the provincial department was outraged.\nThe provincial government issued an important document: within ten days to solve the case, never let the perpetrators go unpunished.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t describe the scene that followed. The city of Anding simply became a stronghold, the various police forces around the area, are converging here one after another.\nCountless elite police officers, countless experts and eyes and ears, in batches and teams rushed over. The city\u0026rsquo;s conference room is too small, then directly into the open air meeting, in the backyard full of tables and chairs.\nThe experts brainstormed, once again analyzed and discussed the case.\nAnd the appearance of the third murder case, also let the previous \u0026ldquo;crime profile\u0026rdquo; contradictory: the killer\u0026rsquo;s target, not only the old and weak male, he also surprisingly brutal to young pregnant women.\nBut this is not a big problem, at least the general direction is correct.\nAfter the experts have repeatedly pushed, more perfect and accurate \u0026ldquo;profile\u0026rdquo;, but also made out.\nAccording to the new profile, the police continue to increase the investigation.\nIn fact, just listen to the data from the visits, it is enough to explain everything: the police footprint, almost covered the four districts of the city of Anding 18 townships, 108 villages, a total of more than 100,000 people, including workers and farmers investigated.\nAs for the key suspects screened out, there were at most 146 at one time. The police next compressed the key suspects to nine people through various rankings and comparisons. These included a station attendant at the Anding City train station.\nThis person was named Wang Jun, or a steward, and was in charge of the VIP waiting room.\nAt that time, the train stations around the world, VIP waiting room has clear rules: the general public need to pay a fee, often five or ten dollars, you can wait here, or even get on the train early. But in the face of military personnel and pregnant women, and even breastfeeding women, it was completely free.\nThe third victim, who came to the VIP waiting room that night, but Wang Jun various difficulties, resulting in this pregnant woman left, and what happened, she ended up dying a horrible death outside.\nSimilarly, the police investigation found that the first two victims, although not to the VIP waiting room, but the night of the murder, the original Wang Jun was not on duty, but he coincidentally came to the train station, but also appeared on the platform.\nThere was a porter named Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, and also with Wang Jun hair greeting it, but Wang Jun tense face, cold expression, even ignored and Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an brushed past.\nAnd the most important, Wang Jun\u0026rsquo;s many personal data, including age, height, etc., are consistent with the profile of the killer.\nThe police called Wang Jun to the police station several times to talk.\nBut each time down, Wang Jun has a very strong attitude denied.\n\u0026ldquo;I killed someone? What a joke! Besides, you dare to mess around and try? My uncle is the station manager of the train station!\u0026rdquo; This was the sentence he replied to the most.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what this guy was thinking, why did he bring out his uncle, is it possible to use his uncle to give himself courage?\nIn this way, the deadline is getting closer and closer, until the tenth day, when the police department was overwhelmed by the enormous pressure to solve the case, someone reported that a neighbor was found in his home suicide.\nThe police temporarily sent two people to the scene, but soon, these two people came back with a fierce news: the deceased is Wang Jun! And he committed suicide in fear of crime!\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/90niandaidaanxilie1/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Murder is sacred\u0026rdquo;: he is the only criminal with the word \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; in his criminal file! Killing is ritualistic!\n\u0026ldquo;Why does everyone tell me that I can\u0026rsquo;t stay longer at the train station?\u0026rdquo; This is a question that many people have asked.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say an answer in my mind: because it is haunted and murderous!\nThis is also a real event that happened many years ago.\nPutting aside the superstition, it is really haunted!","title":"Shaanxi Ghost Train Station, Section 1 (The Act of Murder is Sacred)"},{"content":"7\nMarch 16, 1994\nWang Jun had two homes, one in a building and one in a bungalow with a courtyard. He died in the building, the cause of death was taking a lot of sleeping pills.\nThere is nothing much to say about the death scene, except that there are signs of vomiting, the whole body is quite calm.\nBut in the bungalow, we found a lot of things related to the case.\nOne of them was the murder weapon, a masonry hammer with a sawed-off handle and a lot of dried blood stuck to it. At that time, DNA technology was not widespread, so we can only guess that it was the blood of the three victims.\nSecond, we recovered a lot of perverted books and videotapes. The books alone, mostly related to the gods and goddesses, the most vividly remembered, is the book was circled and annotated Liaozhai. There is a story called \u0026ldquo;dog rape\u0026rdquo;, Wang Jun even in the next blank, even wrote a few: good!\nOf course, we finally found a worn fox fur coat under his bed, and some furry animal hair, the technicians analyzed, are black dog hair.\nWe speculate that every foggy night, Wang Jun will wear this \u0026ldquo;fur\u0026rdquo;, and then the dog hair glued to the face, with this look to the train station to commit crimes.\nBut why is this? We all agree that perhaps with these perverted books and tapes related, especially he was imitating a sperm dog!\nNext, the police did a series of more specific analysis of the motive for the crime: Wang Jun was extremely distorted in his thinking, and the reason why he did it to the first two victims was because they were old and frail, especially one was still stuttering and could not shout when he was killed, and one was lame and would not resist too much.\nAs for killing the pregnant woman, it should be Wang Jun temporary lust. After all, many of his perverted books are incestuous and incestuous things, including scenes depicting the rape and murder of pregnant women.\nAnyway, in the end, the case was well-documented and broken as expected!\nThe police breathed a sigh of relief, and under the Deputy Bureau in charge of criminal investigation, two days later, the police also held a grand celebration banquet.\nFeast personnel, not only the police, but also includes some staff of the railway station, in this ghost case, they have not less effort to cooperate.\nBut to be honest, from the death of Wang Jun, and even until the case is closed, there are still a few people have doubts, including me and Ma Sanshui.\nI talked to Ma Sanshui alone.\nI mean: the ghost case there are many doubts, such as each murder scene on the body, why are so coincidentally there are 11 contusions? Why the killer will burn paper and dance after killing? Especially why each time the scene will be found in the scratched matches?\nMa Sanshui was once stuck. I guess my own questions, but also absolutely put him in a difficult position.\nAnd he, finally answered: \u0026ldquo;Maybe, it\u0026rsquo;s all related to Wang Jun\u0026rsquo;s perversion.\u0026rdquo;\nThe taste out, he did not have much bottom.\n8\nThe night of the celebration banquet.\nThe scene, simply a mountain of people, the entire restaurant, not only was the venue, but also temporarily added a few tables.\nWe the eyes and ears sat at two tables. In fact, the banquet is this rule, the same kind of people sit a piece, so you can also eat the atmosphere.\nNext to us, is the staff of the train station, but one of them, he did not have a seat.\nIn fact, not really lack of a chair and a pair of chopsticks, mainly because he was disliked, even colleagues, no one likes to sit with him a piece.\nI have an impression of him, called Yu Yanan, is that once very active to provide clues to the station porter.\nHe had a nickname, Yu Monkey! Because of the small size. A big old man, less than one meter six feet tall.\nThis is what I am not used to seeing, seeing him standing alone awkwardly, I waved my hand to him, that means, come to us!\nHe also had a good impression of me, then grinned and nodded.\nWhen he sat down, the bearded man put his arm around him: \u0026ldquo;Brother, don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to those bastards! Old Ge and I will have a good drink with you later, we will not return until we are drunk!\u0026rdquo;\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an said yes repeatedly.\nBut if you ask me, the beard is too good at making wine.\nWhen the waiter just brought up the Xifeng, beard to everyone filled up, he also first raised a glass, yelled with a loud voice: \u0026ldquo;Come on, all fucking dry, who does not drink who is this! He also pointed to the crotch of his pants.\nThe result was predictable.\nWhat wine after three rounds, food after five tastes? Not to eat a few bites, there are several eyes and ears slipped out to the table down.\nAlthough Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an has not fallen, but already red face, slightly out of shape.\nHe put his arm around me and kept spitting, saying that he was really tired of living, usually carrying work, so he could not breathe, and those colleagues, because they think he is a runt, they look down on him.\nWhat can I say? Only to keep comforting him.\nDuring this period I also noticed his feet. Sitting on the chair, his feet are off the ground, just a swinging wobble.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, it\u0026rsquo;s fogging again!\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t know who shouted during the meeting.\nEveryone looked out the window, there was a brief moment of silence, and then they all continued to sing and drink.\nThe bearded man wavered and raised his glass again: \u0026ldquo;A good sign ha! This means the ghost case is really over! Brothers, cheers to this, who does not drink who the grandson!\u0026rdquo;\nOf course we gave him support, but for a moment, I noticed that Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an made an odd movement.\nHe secretly glanced at the fog outside the window and smiled disdainfully.\nI was baffled, I was going to ask some follow-up questions through the wine, but suddenly, I looked at his legs and my heart stuttered.\nI recalled an image of the killer kicking me when the foot was \u0026ldquo;soft\u0026rdquo;.\nThis moment, my brain also sweat, are a little sober.\nAfter seeing this scene, the bearded man also laughed, saying that I was weak, to drunk!\nI also feel free to smile, but very hypocritical, completely hard to squeeze out.\n9\nMarch 20, 1994\nThis night was evil, after dark it was foggy, and it was definitely the biggest fog I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen in Anding City.\nI held in my heart an idea, and beard revealed. Of course, all pure speculation, now there are many places still do not understand, but spare, the beard listened to almost opened his mouth in surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t be? Another Lin over the cloud (eighties rain night butcher)?\u0026rdquo; He was still a little unconvinced.\nI stressed: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s try it tonight and find out.\u0026rdquo;\nWe both went to find Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, who was on the job, day and night, for almost nothing.\nWe both found him in the square of the train station. He was wearing overalls and was hustling at the moment.\nTo be frank, this is also a very common phenomenon seen in train stations around the year. Porters to run business, to provide paid services to passengers, in advance to bring on board or carry luggage and so on.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was surprised when he saw me and the beard.\n\u0026ldquo;You guys looking for me?\u0026rdquo; He took the time to ask.\n\u0026ldquo;Something good!\u0026rdquo; Beard replied with a heated smile as he put his arm around him.\nHe listened sparingly, but went with us both to the station.\n\u0026ldquo;Do the police need people to unload the goods?\u0026rdquo; He asked again.\nThere was a crash. I suddenly pulled out a match and struck it in his face.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an glanced at me.\nIn fact, at this time, I was also watching him closely.\nBeard must not feel strong enough, he also came over, and a dozen more at once.\nA ball of fire, in his hands quickly burning.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing?\u0026rdquo; Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an wondered. But listen to the tone of voice, cold a lot.\nThe two of us did not answer positively, and rowed a few more times. \u0026ldquo;Hey! Looking at this fire, you do not have anything to say? For example \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; beard paused and asked tentatively, \u0026ldquo;like let\u0026rsquo;s talk about ghosts?\u0026rdquo;\nNext, I watched, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an with a change of face.\nHe grinned, smiled oddly, and even shivered a little. Just like that line: struck by electricity, and then shivered like a cold shiver.\nThis is not the same angry Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an? He quickly muttered up, saying that the dead cripple, dead stammer, again to bully me, I die rather than his death!\nThe beard and I listened to a confused face.\nAnd Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, he swung his arm, on the momentum to my head smashed.\nBut he forgot, at this time, he did not have a stonework hammer in his hands!\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t let him slip away!\u0026rdquo; I reminded the beard.\nThe two of us wanted to one in front of the other, to pin him in the middle, but he dodged, but the hole.\n\u0026ldquo;Damn, it\u0026rsquo;s just like a monkey!\u0026rdquo; Beard spat.\nThen the two of us played the chase with him.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, how can he be so obsessed with the cargo compartment?\nEventually the beard and I chased another cargo compartment, and I was afraid that the last tragedy would happen again, so I stopped the beard that was about to jump inside.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing?\u0026rdquo; Beard asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Can you beat him in a single fight?\u0026rdquo; I asked in return.\n\u0026ldquo;Just kidding! Who\u0026rsquo;s the old man? The Big Oil of the North Mountain (prison name) back in the day! Fight him? Heh, count him two together!\u0026rdquo; The bearded man looked unimpressed, and then he was surprised, \u0026ldquo;Why do you ask?\u0026rdquo;\nI patted his shoulder, and pushed him hard into the cargo compartment.\nSee how you Yu monkey still play slippery? I thought of this and pushed the door of the cargo compartment hard from the outside.\nI also patted the door of the cargo compartment, that means, in this way indirectly to the beard drumming up energy.\nNext, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what happened inside, anyway, when someone tapped the cargo door again, it was two fast and one slow. This is the usual signal for our ears and eyes.\nI pulled it open from the outside.\nBeard carried the semi-conscious Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an out like a chicken.\nBut at this time, his head shape is a little messy, even the top is still gray and protruding, hanging a lot of dirt dust \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\n10\nWhen the beard and I got Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an back to the police station, that night, I do not know how many people rushed overnight.\nThere are the main police officers of the case, there are also experts, of course, including Ma Sanshui.\nI remember very clearly, he held the profile, standing outside the interrogation room, not a word.\nThis sidebar was also annotated, at first glance dense, there is a kind of messy feeling.\nIn fact, I would like to lament that the profile was once \u0026ldquo;misleading\u0026rdquo;, who would have thought that the killer was only 1.6 meters tall? This is a far cry from the 1.7 meters mentioned in the sidebar.\nBut we can\u0026rsquo;t say that this is an oversight. After all, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was too cunning to wear height-enhancing growth shoes. To go deeper, his cunning is even more than we expected. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget that he also found the perfect scapegoat in Wang Jun.\nThis night, the police tried to pry open Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an\u0026rsquo;s mouth, but now he, almost like a gasbag again, drooping a head, but also can not help but cold words, or he will shrug hair cry.\n\u0026ldquo;Brother Shui, how about forcing a confession!\u0026rdquo; Beard suggested.\nMa Sanshui glared at the beard.\nI also immediately winked at the beard. In fact, his starting point is not malicious, but some words, can not be said!\nEventually Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was taken away, I do not know where to go. Afterwards I heard that the police came to several surprise interrogations, and also sent two psychologists involved.\nA clear motive and passage of the crime, a few days later also presented in front of us.\nAnd it must be mentioned that the first thing Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an confessed, it was quite a fierce material: he said that in the dry toilet in his yard, buried a dead man.\nWe specifically went there, especially after the toilet was dismantled, and saw the unlucky man.\nHe was almost a white bone, and has been composted by the feces, the smell, as you can imagine.\nThe most important feature of the white bones, is that the legs are disabled, to put it bluntly, was a cripple in life.\nWe quickly gathered information about the white bones. The man\u0026rsquo;s name is Gao Yong, once the same as Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, a porter at the station. The most important thing, he stammered and leg crippled, more seriously, is considered a disabled person.\nPerhaps the disability makes him psychologically distorted, or his disabled appearance, but also always met with the eyes of others. Anyway, for various reasons, Gao Yong loves to bully Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an to take the heat off, after all, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an looks so weak, so weak!\nWhat is the extent of bullying? Not only is the work time, after work he also deliberately go to Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an\u0026rsquo;s home, yelling five drinks six not to say, more let Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an to wash his feet and buttocks, all kinds of service to him.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an also reflected with Wang Jun, after all, Wang Jun is the station manager, but Gao Yong and Wang Jun\u0026rsquo;s relationship is very good, every time Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an reflect the situation, not only the stone sunk into the sea, but will be further tortured and beaten by Gao Yong.\n\u0026ldquo;You dead monkey! Dare to snitch on me, I\u0026rsquo;ll cripple you!\u0026rdquo; This is what Gao Yong likes to say every time.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an wrote a diary privately, but recorded, in addition to all the things that Gao Yong tortured him, there was also his experience of a lost love.\nTo be honest, the negative energy of this diary is too much, every time you see it, it will evoke the sadness of Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an.\nAnd this night, under the fog, Gao Yong, the old bachelor, after drunkenness, actually Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an as a woman, \u0026ldquo;defiled\u0026rdquo;.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an broke down and sat alone on the platform, he wanted to die, leaping from the platform. But looking at the train parked on the tracks, such a steel-like behemoth, he was afraid again.\nIf he was run over by the train, he would not be dead! He kept thinking this in his heart.\nAt this moment, I do not know what in the end stimulated him, he struck a match.\nA fire appeared in front of his eyes, and soon went out again.\nIn fact, this also reminds one of a foreign fairy tale: the little girl who sold matches.\nAnyway, under the stimulation of this glowing light, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an bizarre \u0026ldquo;enlightenment\u0026rdquo;, the first is a strange thing in his mind.\nThis thing is furry, with wings.\n\u0026ldquo;Feathered man!\u0026rdquo; Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an immediately associated with it.\nShaanxi, as the location of the ancient capital of the thirteen dynasties, there have been many characteristic cultures passed down here, for example, the feathered man culture is very popular in Anding.\nOn the send old kiln, or in many ancient tombs, will find records about the feathered man. According to archaeologists, the feathered man is a kind of earth immortal with the souls of the dead to ascend to heaven.\nAnd Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an brain after the image of the feathered man, and soon emerged another idea: why I die? Gao Yong bullied me, should not he die?\nNext, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an gradually changed, by no means just a sufferer.\nIt was also a rather brutal crime experience.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an found the opportunity to get Gao Yong drunk, and then use the masonry hammer to cut off the back of his neck.\nWith a bang, Gao Yong\u0026rsquo;s body was thrown in the shit hole of the dry toilet.\nThis is where Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was smart enough to take advantage of the stench of shit to cover up the stench of Gao Yong\u0026rsquo;s corpse.\nAs for Gao Yong\u0026rsquo;s sudden disappearance, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an found an excuse for him to say with the unit, Gao Yong went to sea, went to the south to do business.\nIf placed in the present, this excuse has too many loopholes, but do not forget that in the mid-1990s, under the influence of the wind of reform, countless people have suddenly left without saying goodbye to the unit, \u0026ldquo;to go to sea to do business. And Gao Yong is just a crippled porter, who would care too much about him?\nThen next, Yu Yanan found that every foggy day, his mood swings are great, as if a demon suddenly appeared in his heart.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps the feathered man possessed, he is helping me to complete the metamorphosis, right?\u0026rdquo; Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an thought so.\nAt the very beginning, he only dressed himself up as half human, half ghost and went to wander inside the train station. After all, doing so could make him \u0026ldquo;comfortable\u0026rdquo; and suppress all kinds of weird thoughts in his mind.\nBut gradually, he found that he could not control himself at all. Every foggy day, once he was left alone, an evil thought that scratched his ears would pop up.\nHe started killing people as a result. Under the guise of a porter, he would ask the passengers if they wanted to get on the train early, then swindle them to a remote place, then go down with a hammer, and when the victim fell down, he would dress himself up as a feathered man again and start the next dance and paper burning, etc.\nHe also had specific targets: the welder, who was killed because he stammered and made Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an think of Gao Yong; the kang bun vendor, who was crippled like Gao Yong, so he was brutally murdered.\nAs for the last female victim, the reason she was killed is even more breathless.\nShe has a beauty mole on her chin, once abandoned Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an\u0026rsquo;s girlfriend, also has this one mole.\nWhen killing the first two people, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was once confused. He explained to the police that he felt at the time that he had clearly killed Gao Yong, but why was it a stranger when he later took a closer look?\n\u0026ldquo;It must be an illusion!\u0026rdquo; He soothed himself, but also in order to be able to identify the dead is Gao Yong, he simply stripped off the dead man\u0026rsquo;s autumn pants, over the head of the dead.\n\u0026ldquo;This is Gao Yong!\u0026rdquo; He looked at the body kneeling on the ground and kept nodding his head.\nAs for why there were 11 contusions. Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an\u0026rsquo;s explanation was that Gao Yong had defiled him a total of 11 times before and after.\nSo he wanted revenge by making Gao Yong kneel on the ground and kowtow to atone for his sins, after which he hammered Gao Yong eleven more times!\nThe female victim was different, in addition to the 11 contusions on the brain, the stomach was also hammered once.\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an\u0026rsquo;s explanation: he was particularly hateful, because the \u0026ldquo;girlfriend\u0026rdquo; was pregnant with someone else, so he habitually hammered the female victim\u0026rsquo;s head 11 times, and then the belly to a fierce hammer. He wanted to hammer the child to death!\nThe police finally asked Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an about burning paper and dancing: Why would he do that? Is it a sacrifice to the feathered man inside him? Because the feathered man gave him strength.\nIt is said that Yu monkey broke down on the spot, as if dead, staring with big eyes and not talking. The police were so frightened that they almost called a doctor, but suddenly, Yu Yanan slowed down again.\nHe said he didn\u0026rsquo;t like the feathered man inside him at all, because it was too dominant and too controlling. At that time, after killing people, he looked at the scene of the murder, once blamed himself and regret, but the next moment, he was a new person in general, want to sing and dance.\nSo he wanted to send the feathered man away by burning paper, during which he also struck a match, hoping that the firelight would also help him, after all, in the earliest days, the feathered man was in the firelight. He thought that the feathered man might be able to leave in the light of the fire.\nBut, inviting \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; is easy to send \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; is difficult!\n11\nIn response to Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an\u0026rsquo;s confession. We also discussed it in private.\nTo be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where to put Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, is he an unforgivable person? Or is he himself a victim and somewhat justifiable?\nAnd what does the beard mean: this Yu monkey definitely has a mental illness, bullied by Gao Yong, from the night of the first sodomy began to commit the disease, and then as time goes by, the disease is getting worse.\nAs for Ma Sanshui, what he said seemed very formal.\nHe also mentioned a term: criminal psychological arousal. A weak person, when really pushed to a dead end, under the stimulation of certain specific occasions or circumstances, he will develop hysteria. If this hysteria is not aggressive, then it is appropriate to call it a mental illness. But once driven by hysteria, he began to kill or commit crimes, it is not only pathological, but more should be called the emergence of hysterical criminal personality.\nI repeatedly tasted Ma Sanshui\u0026rsquo;s words.\nMa Sanshui lamented again, saying that Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an has been splitting out of the new personality as a feathered man, but the good thing is that it is only the initial stage, otherwise really wait for the \u0026ldquo;feathered man\u0026rdquo; to fatten up, it will completely replace Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an, then there will be more innocent people were killed!\n12\nPostscript\nBefore he was sentenced, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was sent to a detention center.\nIt is said that he became more and more eccentric at that time, and it seemed that the Yu monkey, itself, was gradually disappearing.\nIn the detention center, Yu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was also particularly fond of babbling nonsense.\nOne of his favorite things to say was that a rabbit had killed a man and escaped into the forest. The police could not do anything about the rabbit, whether they sent experts to analyze it or got police officers to search the mountain, but they could not find it.\nWhat did the police do in the end? They caught a bear, when the police dragged the bear out of the forest, the bear was bruised and swollen, are crying.\nThe bear cried and said, \u0026ldquo;Stop fighting, I\u0026rsquo;m a rabbit!\u0026rdquo;\nYu Yan\u0026rsquo;an was particularly self-indulgent, and every time he finished, he clapped his hands and laughed for a while.\nAt that time when the beard and I heard about this, the beard directly spat: \u0026ldquo;stupid than!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I, a soft sigh: \u0026ldquo;Poor rabbit!\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/90niandaidaanxilie2/","summary":"7\nMarch 16, 1994\nWang Jun had two homes, one in a building and one in a bungalow with a courtyard. He died in the building, the cause of death was taking a lot of sleeping pills.\nThere is nothing much to say about the death scene, except that there are signs of vomiting, the whole body is quite calm.\nBut in the bungalow, we found a lot of things related to the case.","title":"Shaanxi Ghost Train Station, Section 2 (I am a rabbit)"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Murderer, Me!\u0026rdquo; : He was extremely twisted and played a provocative game with the police with his bizarre and sadistic methods of killing!\nDo you know how scary it is to be friends with a man with a twisted mind?\nHe has a theory of his own, and whether it\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s irrefutable! If you look at you, he will change the way to be good to you, even he can not use the things to give you. But once you anger him, the world will immediately be a living person less, more a corpse abused! What degree of abuse? It can be said that the scene, after anyone look at it, it will be like a nightmare, along with you for life \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nSay a real case that happened many years ago. I will try my best to restore it as a personal witness, so that everyone can see what this murderer, whom we call the most twisted in the country, is really like. And what was it like to be friends with him?\n(The following part of the scene may cause discomfort, resistance to stress is not strong, it is recommended to stop!)\nJune 28, 1993.\nIt was an early morning when everyone was asleep, and we were all standing under the flagpole of a wheat farm called Baoshan County for a long time.\nOriginally, this should have been a red flag on it, but at this time, there was only a headless male corpse.\nAn iron hook, hard into the chest of the corpse, hanging it on the flagpole, strong wind blowing, it is still with the wind, a swaying.\nThe corpse was dressed in an earthy green uniform, but this does not necessarily mean that the deceased was a soldier. In those days, in small places like Baoshan County, wearing a military uniform was still a trend.\nWaiting for a closer look, the uniform was very flat. It gave the impression that it was either new or had been carefully washed or even ironed.\nThe top of the uniform was seeped through with a small amount of blood, and a small pool of blood was also distributed directly below the body. As for the scene, especially around the flagpole, there were various messy footprints and blood spots distributed.\nThe most impressive thing was that someone had written a line in chalk on the flagpole: \u0026ldquo;Murderer, me!\nTo be honest, my brain was in a mess. For one reason, the scene was brutal. It was clear that the killer cut off the head and immediately hung the headless body.\nWith blood, hanging alive!\nIt is estimated that the \u0026ldquo;flag\u0026rdquo;, the body is not yet dead, it is likely that the hands and feet will twitch a little.\nIn addition, I always feel that something is not right.\nFirst of all, I have seen cases of abuse and murder, the most ruthless scene, the victim was lynched, the kind of death by a thousand cuts. Or cook the whole body, and then on the face and body graffiti.\nBut the corpse in front of me, in the clothing even neatly.\nIf it is a sadistic murder, why let the dead so decent?\nSecondly, what does the killer mean by leaving this message? Is it a provocation?\nHalf an hour later, someone came over with a police dog. This is also a feature of the nineties to handle cases, there was no powerful skynet and DNA technology, in the field scene investigation, often have to use the dog nose.\nThe police dog searched the neighborhood for quite some time and eventually found a new clue from a wheat stack thirty meters away from the flagpole. A trampled cassette tape.\nThe tape had bloody fingerprints on it, indicating that the killer had discarded it.\nAnother horrible thought came to me as a result: the killer was killing people while listening to a song. But whose song? Little Tiger or Jacky Cheung?\nIntroduce myself. Everyone calls me Lao Ge, in the nineties engaged in a special occupation - special case gray eyes and ears, which is also the predecessor of the later 321 (criminal special intelligence).\nAs anyone who has been there knows, there were more big and important cases in those days, and the police force was seriously inadequate, and prisoners like me, who were slightly skilled, were \u0026ldquo;recruited\u0026rdquo; and became a forceful auxiliary force.\nAfter I returned from the scene, together with a few eyes and ears, attended the police case analysis meeting.\nOf course, we people can only sit in the last row of chairs. My partner beard, a former prison oil (prison head prison bully), he was not listening at all. I on the contrary, very carefully taking notes.\nBeard secretly spit with me: \u0026ldquo;This gang of big brothers (public security) pure pants fart, the murder occurred, go early to arrest people! What meeting? To me is the murderer, take advantage of this period, must have escaped ten miles away again.\u0026rdquo;\nI do not agree. Really let him say so, it is called brutality! And I then answered the question, \u0026ldquo;Do you think the killer will escape?\u0026rdquo;\nSeeing my serious face, he also put away his joking heart.\n\u0026ldquo;Escape? With such a disgusting killing method, this person is extremely strong psychologically! Maybe now are home to sleep!\u0026rdquo; This is his original words.\nNext, the police decided to take a two-pronged approach.\nOne is to check the source of the corpse; the second is to rank the suspect, the murder scene as the center, in a five-mile radius, do a large-scale visit.\nThe beard and I were assigned the task, originally in a place called the White Village action, and folks to inquire and inquire.\nBut it only lasted half a day, the upper line (scout) Ma Sanshui paged me: urgent, return quickly!\nI knew there must be another new clue. But I did not expect that it could be so bizarre.\nForgive me for the wording, but so described, not exaggerated at all.\nThe forensic autopsy found that the deceased once ate a very rich dinner, especially with beef.\nAt that time, Baoshan County is very backward, we still receive meat stamps, and even many people in order to eat more oil, often buy fat back to boil oil.\nSo the beard and I were surprised to hear the word beef.\n\u0026ldquo;Brother Shui, according to you, the deceased is still a money man ha!\u0026rdquo; Beard first to express his views.\nMa Sanshui sunken face, then broke the news of another incident.\nWhen the forensic pathologist took off the clothes of the deceased, actually smelled his body stinks.\n\u0026ldquo;Does the corpse stink?\u0026rdquo; This time I asked first.\nMa Sanshui shook his head: \u0026ldquo;More like vomiting in the smell of sweat! Especially the crotch there, also particularly smoky, I guess it has not been a long time to shower.\u0026rdquo;\nI wondered even more. Can afford to eat beef, but personal hygiene is so poor?\nFinally Ma Sanshui found a Walkman, put a cassette tape into it.\nIt was actually the one damaged at the scene, which was now repaired.\nI have a feeling of eager anticipation, wondering what in the end will hear?\nI guessed for a while before that it would be some kind of song, but when I listened for a short while, I was surprised and almost grew my mouth.\nThis seems to be a scene of some kind, someone crying, someone laughing, and someone humming and yapping, saying that he is sending gong. And hair gong this person also stressed several times that his skills are very powerful, listen to the tape can also, the same his gong can also heal the listener.\n\u0026ldquo;Qi, qigong?\u0026rdquo; When Ma Sanshui pressed the pause button, the beard asked speculatively.\nMa Sanshui nodded: \u0026ldquo;This is a tape of a qigong master healing. This person\u0026rsquo;s name is Zhang Jianjun, catching up with the people of Baoshan County! And the police just investigated, he was once a butcher before learning qigong!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Quite a bully! Butcher to learn qigong, and also learned!\u0026rdquo; Hu Zi spat.\nAnd I understood what Ma Sanshui meant. This Zhang Jianjun, has been listed as an important suspect. Think about it, he worked as a butcher, and there were tapes about him at the crime scene.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that this is a qigong master murder case? But what was the motive? With wacky techniques, research how to kill people to cure diseases?\nMa Sanshui said, which took us both to find Zhang Jianjun.\nOf course, the occasion of departure, he deliberately pointed down the head: \u0026ldquo;You guys get ready, this Zhang Jianjun, I heard here is not ordinary!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Twisted? Twisted?\u0026rdquo; Beard asked after.\nMa Sanshui an intriguing expression, did not answer again.\nZhang Jianjun gave me the first impression, simply too recognizable.\nHe had a face of flesh, but had to comb a big back hair, waxed the kind of hair. In addition to the occasion of the door, I found that he was wearing an earthy green military uniform, no pleats on it.\nMa Sanshui bright public security documents, but did not wait to say anything, Zhang Jianjun casually waved a hand, let us in.\nIt looked like coaxing a chicken or herding a duck.\n\u0026ldquo;Damn it!\u0026rdquo; Hu Zi almost fumed on the spot, but I stabbed him.\nIn fact, I was also uncomfortable in my heart, but the case was in front of me. And I did not forget to secretly remind the beard, \u0026ldquo;forget how the officer asked us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Smile and have quality. I know!\u0026rdquo; Beard impatiently interrupted, but also deliberately to me a grin.\nIt was almost like crying, especially the two big yellow teeth.\nI told him not to smile, just do not mess up later.\nSoon we sat in the living room of Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s house, I observed, his family is very rich, probably related to his current occupation.\nIn the nineties, it was a very big deal to know qigong, and there was a time when qigong fever was popular. How hot was it? Countless people competed to learn it, including even celebrities, officials, and foreign dignitaries.\nSo with this, I felt a little emotion in my heart.\nThis Zhang Jianjun, however, did not give us a chance to speak, and no one could interrupt. He was simply talking about qigong-related matters.\nFirst, the mystery of qigong, and his master is a famous who, after he learned, how to use qigong to universalize all beings, to the people\u0026rsquo;s welfare to cure the disease.\nI looked at the watch, a full twenty minutes. Only after that Ma Sanshui found the opportunity to ask about the case.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the matter? I, a master respected by everyone, have become a suspect?\u0026rdquo; He shouted in exasperation.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that, I hope you can assist the police!\u0026rdquo; Ma Sanshui tried to explain.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t give me that! Call my lawyer if you need anything!\u0026rdquo; He finished and grabbed the phone.\nI realized that the only thing we had done on this visit was to listen to Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s blind bragging.\nWhen we got out, the beard suggested that there was nothing to talk about with this kind of goods, let him go back alone again and have a good talk with the other side.\nBut Ma Sanshui stopped the beard, he gave us both instructions: stakeout!\nI understand the difficulty of Ma Sanshui, to be honest, this kind of small famous qigong master, really do not cooperate, the police also really headache.\nAnd next, we both moved to the opposite side of Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s house.\nThis is a dilapidated private house. At that time, it was still a public housing system, this residence because it was too dilapidated, the original residents moved out, and it was empty. So it\u0026rsquo;s convenient for me and the beard.\nTo reveal in advance, it is this stalking, the beard and I completely confused.\nBecause one night, this \u0026ldquo;Zhang Jianjun\u0026rdquo;, at the same time, but in a different place appeared. A bizarre case of abuse and murder, also appeared \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nJune 30, 1993\nThe first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. The reason is that the manpower is too tight, this stakeout, it has been me and beard.\nThe two of us discussed, simply six hours a round of posts.\nWho is on duty, sitting in front of the window, looking across through binoculars.\nThe beard is an old man, so he used to pass the time in very few ways, in addition to sucking the root of the turret, is to look at the sky.\nI\u0026rsquo;m different, every time stalking, choose to look at the newspaper.\nIn fact, from reading the newspaper, I know how much of a headache the police have now.\nVarious local dailies and evening newspapers, as well as newspapers from neighboring cities, have published body claim notices on them.\nThe problem is, this is a headless corpse, without knowing exactly what the body looks like, and someone dares to take a chance on it?\nI have therefore also thought about the question: where is the head in the end?\nWe, the people, and the dogs, searched the murder scene several times over and over again, but never found it.\nIn the end, the killer has a quirk? Or is it that the head itself has something to say?\nIn this way, I stayed up until midnight.\nAt night, Baoshan County is very quiet, there are no street lights, take a look, where there is a darkness.\nOriginally, I was breathing heavily and holding on to sleep. But all of a sudden, there was movement across the courtyard door.\nI shook my head, let myself wake up some, also immediately close binoculars.\nIt was Zhang Jianjun, who, like a thief, looked left and right immediately after opening the door, and he was holding a long object, wrapped in newspaper.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s he up to?\u0026rdquo; A question mark popped up in my head.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t say he went to see anyone at night with qigong, fools will believe it!\nJust wait to confirm that no one is around, Zhang Jianjun left the house. But looking at his walking posture, I was even more amazed.\nHow shivering, which made me think of cerebral thrombosis patients.\nAnd his final destination was a garbage can.\nHe threw that stuff in with a brain and walked home with another cerebral thrombosis-like stride.\n\u0026ldquo;Beard, hey!\u0026rdquo; I called to him immediately.\nHe was snoring and woke up, still a little confused from the cold.\n\u0026ldquo;Zhang Jianjun just left the house!\u0026rdquo; I reminded him.\nBeard yawned: \u0026ldquo;Qigong master is also a man, I understand, can not stand loneliness, looking for a woman, right?\u0026rdquo;\nI said he has a problem with this thinking, what is this thinking ah?\nI said two more simple words.\nThe beard froze for a moment, and then immediately put on his shoes.\nThe two of us took advantage of the night and sneaked to the garbage can.\nI held up a flashlight, the beard is not too dirty, reach out in the inside of the search.\nSoon there was a discovery. The beard took the thing out and pulled the top newspaper.\nThis moment, we both silent.\nThis is a boning knife, very common in the meat stall. And at this time this knife, blood stains.\nIt was all dried blood.\n\u0026ldquo;The evidence is overwhelming! I\u0026rsquo;ll see how that bragging goods still pretend!\u0026rdquo; Beard said, and quickly wrapped the knife again.\nHis intention, a direct kick down and break into the door.\nBut when we came to the courtyard door, we both heard that there was movement in the courtyard, as if someone was shoveling dirt.\nBeard gestured the shape of a human head. This is a silent reminder to me.\nAnd Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s courtyard wall is not high, it is difficult for me and the beard.\nWe both went around, picked the right place, and gently climbed up.\nImagine, the moon is high and windy night, the two of us lying on the wall, looking down at the scene: Zhang Jianjun clip flashlight, is digging a pit with a shovel, and in the middle of the pit, really placed a bloody human head.\nThis human head is also a bit of signs of corruption, a group of flies, hovering above it buzzing.\nZhang Jianjun is also definitely too focused, has not noticed the two of us.\nBut the beard really can\u0026rsquo;t help it, suddenly came to a voice. Also do not say, with a shocking thunder about the same power!\n\u0026ldquo;Tally! Master! What are you doing?\u0026rdquo;\nZhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s feet like a spring, whoosh jumped up, and then before he could look up, he poofed again, lying on the ground.\nBefore the police rushed over, Zhang Jianjun smoked several times. I suspect it was scared by the beard this voice.\nThe pumping that is called a powerful, spitting white foam, hands are with the chicken claws have a fight.\nI was also worried, how to do? The master must not be drawn to death!\nBut the beard has a trick, according to him, when he was in prison, it is not uncommon to see this kind of guy committing smoking disease.\nI thought he knew about medicine, who knew that the next, he aimed at Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s face, left and right snapped two sounds.\nI do not know what principle, but I have to say, people are better \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nAfter coming to the interrogation room, Zhang Jianjun a little master of the frame are no longer, simply with the bamboo beans, and we said that he would not what qigong, his master will not, and his master was once a street art, will be a little biased only.\nI pinched the watch to see, he confessed so twenty minutes. But the problem also came.\nInterrogation police patted the table: \u0026ldquo;Comrade, the deceitful thing to put on the back burner, you first explain the experience of killing!\u0026rdquo;\nZhang Jianjun seems to have thought of something, gah, and to faint.\nSee this, I guess his image of this qigong master, is completely pulled to!\nAnd the next, even I thought, the case has been solved, who knows where to where this?\nZhang Jianjun confessed: he is not a murderer, just heard movement in the yard at night, he thought into the thieves, but went out to see, there is a nook on the ground of the soil is very new, like being buried again after digging. And this also put a newspaper wrapped things, open a look, is a bloody knife.\nHe was so frightened that his first thought was to throw the thing away. When he came back, he wondered again, what was odd in that piece of soil, the result of digging out a look \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nOriginally his words, we do not believe.\nThink about it, in the middle of the night, the killer ate enough to go to his house to destroy evidence? The middle of nowhere is not much stronger than his home?\nBut Zhang Jianjun finally pointed to the light, and kneeled down to swear, even the ancestors are moved out, anyway, all kinds of assurance that he did not kill.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s even more bizarre is that two hours later, the police received a report that a body was found in the smoke bed of Bai Village, and the time of death was the latter part of last night, and the murderer was Zhang Jianjun!\nThe reason why we can be so sure of the murderer is that at the crime scene, the murderer left a handwriting: \u0026ldquo;Murderer, me! Zhang Jianjun!\u0026rdquo;\nThe beard and I had been to the White Village before, so we knew a little about the situation here.\nThe villagers all grow tobacco, and the tobacco bed has become a very typical building here. To put it bluntly, it is a kind of simple house built with adobe.\nWhen we arrived at the scene with Ma Sanshui, a cordon was drawn here.\nForgive me for being mentally prepared, but the moment I went in, my heart still stuttered.\nThe same killing method. A headless male corpse was hung by an iron hook, hanging from a beam inside the house, the upper half of his uniform and the floor, were distributed with dried blood.\nAnd on a piece of wall in the smoke bed, simply too striking, were written two lines. The first line: \u0026ldquo;Murderer, me! Zhang Jianjun!\u0026rdquo;\nThe second line: \u0026ldquo;No, beast!\u0026rdquo;\nBeard and I exploded then. Beard cursed and grinned.\nIf it were normal, Ma Sanshui would have criticized the beard and told him to pay attention to quality. But at this time, he just sullen face.\nIn fact, which I do not understand, the beard\u0026rsquo;s scolding, but also scolded the heart of everyone!\nThis murderer, simply arrogant can!\nOf course, I in order to bite the right thing, deliberately asked the forensic pathologist: \u0026ldquo;the time of death to determine the second half of last night?\u0026rdquo;\nHe just pointed to the survey box.\nHere sat a thermometer with some sticky, yellowish stuff stuck to it.\nI guess he had just measured the anal temperature of the body.\n\u0026ldquo;So, Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s suspicion is ruled out?\u0026rdquo; I thought silently.\nOr unless Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, knows some kind of diversion, which can appear in different places at the same time.\nThe police also brought in police dogs and searched extensively with the smoke bed as the center.\nWe all thought that the tape would be found again, but the result was nothing.\nOn the contrary, the forensic pathologist found a new bizarre.\nThe dead man\u0026rsquo;s hand was clutching a screw.\nAt that time, in order to take it off, the forensic pathologist almost broke the corpse\u0026rsquo;s fingertips.\nIt looks ordinary, in hardware stores or construction sites can be found everywhere, or walking in the street, get a bad pick up.\nMa Sanshui stressed: this is an important clue, it is likely that the deceased to tell us something.\nThe problem is that the police have been studying for a long time, but in the end there is no accurate statement.\nSome people believe that the deceased intended to say that the killer is a construction worker; others believe that this is instead a false clue deliberately left by the killer.\nAnd then combined with the common and suspicious points of these two cases: the deceased had eaten a sumptuous dinner before death, wearing a very neat military uniform, the body itself is very smelly \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; so these things.\nThe case was at once at an impasse.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/90niandaidaanxilie3/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Murderer, Me!\u0026rdquo; : He was extremely twisted and played a provocative game with the police with his bizarre and sadistic methods of killing!\nDo you know how scary it is to be friends with a man with a twisted mind?\nHe has a theory of his own, and whether it\u0026rsquo;s right or wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s irrefutable!

Originally, the police ruled him out, after all, the second murder, he had an absolute alibi. As for why there was a human head and murder weapon in his house? Why did the murderer have to leave his name at the scene? The police have not yet come to a conclusion, some suspect that perhaps the killer had an axe to grind with him.\nOriginally also let him go, Ma Sanshui, taking into account various reasons, also sent a police officer, 24-hour \u0026ldquo;protection\u0026rdquo; of him.\nThe problem is that one night in late July, Zhang Jianjun disappeared. Right under the officer\u0026rsquo;s nose, he took the opportunity to go to the toilet in the courtyard and disappeared. And the police searched with all their might for three days, even to his old home, but could not find him again.\nDid he escape over the courtyard wall by himself? But why did he do that?\nBeard thought: this master or a ghost in his heart, there must be a suspicion!\nSecond, say the source of the body on. Because the first dead man\u0026rsquo;s head was found, the police gave it a restoration, but also finally found.\nThe deceased was actually a demented, had been in the city to ask for food. This also explains, why his body stinks!\nThe police therefore made a bold speculation, the second body, should also be a demented person.\nAlthough so far, no heads have been found, not locked the source of the corpse, but the Baoshan County police asked for help from the provincial department, sent a big forensic doctor. I do not know how this big forensic doctor in the end, I heard that she also once studied the body\u0026rsquo;s teeth and anus, and finally she concluded that the deceased is also a demented person.\nFinally, the news of the killer. Unfortunately, there is nothing! Not even an eyewitness!\nIn order to be able to solve the case, the next not to mention the police, we are the eyes and ears are not idle.\nIn Baoshan County, especially in the White Village, a large number of people were deployed to visit and investigate during the day, and patrol and set up checkpoints at night.\nSome of the other eyes and ears dressed as demented, were assigned to different places to go along the streets to beg for a living.\nOriginally the beard once also dressed up, but he simply is not that material. Kneeling in the street, his eyes lit up when he saw the more trendy, especially in bell-bottom pants lesbians. This is by no means the standard for dementia!\nAnd above all, we also kept an eye on the really demented people. But this kind of people, at that time in Baoshan County is not a lot, the police got hold of, there are more than thirty.\nThis also shows how important eugenics is.\nOf course, we suffered at the same time, also once thought that such a high-intensity network of heaven and earth, the killer will not be able to hide for too long.\nBut in fact, he continued to be unscrupulous.\nIn late July 1993, a headless man\u0026rsquo;s body was found hanging in an abandoned explosives house in a precinct called Yangzhen. The murderer left a note on the spot: \u0026ldquo;I, Zhang Jianjun! Killed the beast!\u0026rdquo;\nIn early August, one also appeared next to a water pond called Xiaojia Village. And I saw a row of blood at the scene, the kind of sparse blood spots. It stretched from underneath the corpse to the middle of the pond.\nOn the corpse, this time there was a white cloth hanging directly over it, on which was written, \u0026ldquo;Come to me! Zhang Jianjun!\u0026rdquo;\nAugust 11, 1993.\nThe police suspected that there were important clues inside the pond, especially since three more heads had not been found in these four murders.\nSo the police brought in fire trucks and large pumps to prepare to suck the pond dry.\nAnd I, bitterly, became the night duty officer.\nWe all know how uncomfortable such places are at night, in the middle of summer, it\u0026rsquo;s full of mosquitoes.\nI had to put on a thick windbreaker, although hot, but gritted his teeth and held on. Also lit two trays of mosquito incense beside me.\nThe night is not lonely for me. At the same time, many other eyes and ears are also in different posts guard.\nWe use the walkie-talkie, looking at each other from a distance, but also to pass the time.\nAt two o\u0026rsquo;clock in the night, the beard looked for me again.\nOriginally he was purely pulling useless, a moment to talk to me about the girl\u0026rsquo;s flower skirt, and a moment to say which widow in Baoshan County\u0026rsquo;s doorstep right and wrong, etc..\nI criticized him: \u0026ldquo;Comrade! Let you visit, is to solve the case, look at you, what have you investigated?\u0026rdquo;\nHu Zi hehe smiled, then a change of topic.\n\u0026ldquo;Lao Ge, have you heard? This afternoon, the local police passed the case information to the provinces, supposedly looking for a criminal psychology master to analyze it. Hey! Another master oh!\u0026rdquo;\nAt the end, he deliberately in the \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; on the tone of voice.\nI did not think the same as he did. This master is not the other master, the police can find, that must have two brilliance.\nI asked him to continue and tell how the psychologist followed up the analysis.\nAcross the street suddenly came a pop, I guess he was hitting the mosquitoes.\nThen he: \u0026ldquo;This master said that the police were wrong before the direction, the killer is taking care of the body, not simply in the abuse of the body. Listen, is it a fart? All hang the body as a red flag, and cut off the head, is not the abuse of the corpse is what?\u0026rdquo;\nI hesitated for a moment, but still asked, \u0026ldquo;The expert did not explain why?\u0026rdquo;\nBeard thought for a long time, and then said: \u0026ldquo;seems to have something to do with the knife, right? That master said, the four corpses on the neck wound is very detailed, like \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; right right, surgery! General murder, are under a vicious hand, a few knives or a few axes to cut off the head, and this murderer it, using all the small broken knife, like surgery, a little cut, so the wound on the neck of the corpse will look very flat, even very neat.\u0026rdquo;\nBeard came up with a vomiting look: \u0026ldquo;Lao Ge, you say amusing, but also psychological experts, can the killer\u0026rsquo;s modus operandi so literary, I also heard for the first time!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I fell into contemplation, also recalled.\nYes! The corpse\u0026rsquo;s neck is indeed the same as the expert described.\nThe beard originally continued to want to spit all kinds of, presumably want to take the expert as a fun.\nBut I did not give him the opportunity, but instead asked: \u0026ldquo;What else did the expert say? You kid one by one, tell me what you know.\u0026rdquo;\nI could feel that the beard became very uninteresting, but then he also stressed: \u0026ldquo;The experts let the police change the routine, do not be traditional, especially do not investigate after the crime, but also do not simply cast a large net. Experts concluded that this time, facing a killer with a twisted mind, it is likely that he has his own set of theories and laws, so it is necessary to know him to know me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s called knowing yourself and knowing your enemy!\u0026rdquo; I interjected and corrected.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, right! And you\u0026rsquo;re educated!\u0026rdquo; Beard nodded and continued, \u0026ldquo;The expert concluded that the criminal had some connection with Zhang Jianjun, not as simple as simply having a grudge or something like that. And driven by this unique psychology, the killer will continue to commit the crime, so experts reminded the police to strengthen the investigation and control of such people. In addition it is said ha, experts continue to study again, trying to analyze as soon as possible more about the psychology of criminals, to this side of the police to pass over.\u0026rdquo;\nI was silent, the beard must be something else at this point, he turned off the intercom.\nIn fact, since being the eyes and ears, I have been vaguely aware of a problem, and really just like the experts said, we are too passive.\nWhen it comes to ordinary murder cases, which is fine, but when faced with this \u0026ldquo;abnormal\u0026rdquo; murderer, also because we can not capture his true psychology, so we have been led by the nose.\n(It was not until \u0026lsquo;94 that the domestic police overhauled and introduced criminal psychology. (Before that, most of the places are mainly based on traditional crime solving methods.)\nOriginally, I followed the expert\u0026rsquo;s thinking, and then pondered up on their own, to see with their own brains, can not have any good ideas, but inadvertently a look up, I found a dark shadow in the woods by the pond.\nI do not know when he came, anyway, just standing there, has been looking at me.\n\u0026ldquo;Who?\u0026rdquo; I shouted.\nHe waved his hand, looking anxious, and was urging me to go over.\nBecause the distance is too far, even with a flashlight shake, I can not see the person\u0026rsquo;s face.\nAfter he urged again, he also turned around and walked away first.\nI\u0026rsquo;m afraid it\u0026rsquo;s a villager or something, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that the folks have found something again?\nI tucked away the walkie-talkie and hurried over.\nThe woods were relatively dense and leafy, and after going deeper into them, I had a terrible view.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey!\u0026rdquo; I shouted, also waiting for the man\u0026rsquo;s response.\nBut apart from hearing a few old crow calls, there was nothing else.\n\u0026ldquo;Going so fast!\u0026rdquo; I muttered and was wondering what to do next.\nThere was a drop, and a small piece of my head was wet.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s raining?\u0026rdquo; I touched it in wonder, and raised my head in passing.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s the move, bad!\nI watched as a man squatted in the branches of the tree above my head. And he had thrown a piece of white stuff down.\nThe force was great, and the speed was fast.\nWith a snap, it whole paste in my face.\nWhat a sweet taste! Only one bite down, my legs went weak, and the whole sky spun in front of me.\nI remembered that the pat flower, is the nineties a con man on the street the usual means. To put it bluntly, that are very potent ecstasy.\nSee me stagger this is going to fall, the branch of the tree this man leapt down.\nHe also took a few quick steps to try to help me.\n\u0026ldquo;Careful! The ground is hard!\u0026rdquo; He repeatedly said twice.\nAt this point, I could not open my mouth, I could only open my heart and greet his ancestors once. Because he was the one who knocked me out, and then he came to play the good guy!\nThe moment I was about to close my eyes, I also saw him touch his waist, pulled out an iron hook!\nOriginally I thought I was dead. Any fool would know that I had met the right man! He had the audacity to sneak back to the scene of the crime in the night, to revisit a former place.\nBut after some confused sleep, I woke up.\nI found myself in an abandoned house, the sky seemed to be just dawn, so the house was not so dark.\nAt that moment I heard again, it seemed that someone was talking. I slowly turned my head to look.\nThis is a man of about thirty years old, not much character, is placed in the crowd are not conspicuous kind. At this moment, he looked lazy, leaning against the window, holding my walkie-talkie, and was chatting with other earthers.\nMy head buzzed and I finally remembered it all.\nI tried to struggle, tried to scream. The problem was that I was tied up and had a piece of duct tape stuck to my mouth.\nHe had noticed my movements, but just grinned and nodded at me.\nAt this moment, I froze, my brain also whooshed to see sweat.\nTo be honest, this performance of the murderer made me scared! If at this point he is smiling and vicious, for me, but nothing, this kind of evil people, in fact, not so difficult to communicate.\nI\u0026rsquo;m afraid to meet this kind of in front of me, because he is too perverse!\nI struggled some more and then gave up. After all, it is better to leave some strength.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also watching and even listening to him.\nIn fact, for this case, we have these eyes and ears from all directions, most of them are not familiar with each other. This is cheap for the killer.\nWhenever he spoke, everyone treated him as one of their own.\nWe all had a mixed conversation, but soon, the beard popped up and also said one of the latest developments.\n\u0026ldquo;Guys, the police have sent word again that the psycho-guru has made a judgment, and he thinks the reason the killer killed demented people was to give them a break! Let these types of people suffer less in this world, so that explains why the killer provided a rich dinner for the deceased before killing them, and even dressed them in such neat clothes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Correct me, it\u0026rsquo;s a military uniform! It was produced by the Baoshan Garment Factory, and it was the best that this factory could produce.\u0026rdquo; The killer suddenly interjected.\nNot only the beard, everyone eeked.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know so well, brother?\u0026rdquo; Beard asked curiously.\nThe murderer grinned: \u0026ldquo;I just heard from the police, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can not ah, we this piece, I am the messenger ah.\u0026rdquo; Hu Zi muttered a sentence.\nThe murderer deliberately digressed, let the beard continue to talk about the psychological master.\nBeard: \u0026ldquo;The master guessed again that the murderer is likely to be a qigong enthusiast, which is why he left that tape at the scene. As for that screw, there is probably nothing special about it, because demented patients, like children, like to grab something to play with.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tsk!\u0026rdquo; The killer deliberately so a few sounds. \u0026ldquo;This master is not bad, at least much better than fortune tellers. In fact, his analysis is similar to what I thought.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a pause in his voice, he continued: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you my opinion. That screw, must be used to play, the deceased was not honest at the time, can only use this screw, to distract his attention.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As for qigong enthusiasts, this well, I think the master said wrong, the killer will not qigong, the reason for the existence of that tape, because Zhang Jianjun once advertised that his qigong function to cure all diseases, including brain disease, of course, so the killer held the attitude of curing and saving people, to the deceased played the tape several times, and the results, simply useless!\u0026rdquo;\nIntercom silence up.\nI just feel that time has suddenly frozen with the same.\nThis is also the first time I saw, the killer took the initiative to introduce the case and suspicion.\nAfter a few seconds, the beard came up with an interested look: \u0026ldquo;Man, I think you go to be a psychological master can be okay, your analysis is very incisive, to meet, which prison out of the previous?\u0026rdquo;\nThe killer laughed.\nAnd I was angry, that is, I could not see the beard, or quasi-choke him to death. Along with this, I also scolded these are using the walkie-talkie earpiece, how each head with a mallet, no one reacted to it?\nNext, the killer took the place of the master and talked to everyone about his unique analysis.\n\u0026ldquo;First of all, why the killer cut off the head of the deceased, because it is the head of the trouble. It was broken! That\u0026rsquo;s why the deceased suffered in this life, living like an animal, not experiencing the happiness of a normal human being.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Secondly, the reason why the body was hung. This is actually a very sacred practice, because the murderer hopes that the deceased will ascend to heaven after death and be reincarnated in the next life!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As for why leave a name at the scene, it is very simple, the murderer did such a good thing, it is difficult to learn from Lei Feng? Do good deeds do not leave a name?\u0026rdquo; Of course, at the end of the day, many ears are curious, say no, the murderer is obviously planted, leaving the name of qigong master Zhang Jianjun at the scene.\nThe murderer shook his head vigorously and questioned, \u0026ldquo;called Zhang Jianjun must refer to the fake master? Can\u0026rsquo;t the murderer himself be called Zhang Jianjun?\u0026rdquo;\nPredictably, his analysis, and finally won the praise of all, especially the beard, the stupid bastard also said: \u0026ldquo;Brother, brain enough! I\u0026rsquo;m convinced! Drink one together some day!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I, during this period is absolutely suffering, the heart is almost suffocating to explode!\nI saw that everyone was going to break up the game. I know, I do not do something, it will be too late!\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/90niandaidaanxilie4/","summary":"July 1993.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t even know how many times the police had a case analysis meeting.\nDuring this month, various clues were collected one after another.\nFirst, Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, gave the police a headache.

This caught the attention of the killer, Zhang Jianjun.\nHe temporarily turned off the intercom and asked me again, \u0026ldquo;Where are you not feeling well? Do you want to sleep again.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter saying that, he took out a pocket, took out a plastic bag, which was sealed with a white handkerchief.\nWhich I do not understand, immediately shook his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Then what did you just wave?\u0026rdquo; He cursed.\nI thought to myself that this is called a wave? But I remembered what the master psychologist had said earlier. The killer\u0026rsquo;s mind is twisted, not the same as normal people, with his own set of theories, so this kind of people, or not to contradict him for the better.\nI forced down my heart all sorts of uneasiness, as gentle as possible, with him again shaking his head to show.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t expect a good effect. He walked up to me and tore a piece of tape off my mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing?\u0026rdquo; He at least didn\u0026rsquo;t curse anymore, but took the initiative to ask me.\nI stared at the intercom and looked at him again. \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t shown my face in a long time, and if I keep this up, someone will get suspicious!\u0026rdquo;\nHe came up with a thoughtful look.\n\u0026ldquo;I know the rules and won\u0026rsquo;t talk nonsense, just let me show my face here (on the walkie-talkie)!\u0026rdquo; I gestured.\nHe finally agreed and put the walkie-talkie in front of my mouth, but at the same time, he also raised the iron hook so that the tip of the hook was pointed at my eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t mess up, okay?\u0026rdquo; He warned with a serious look on his face.\nI nodded my head.\nWhen he turned on the intercom, I remained staring at him, which was actually a little trick; I was steadying him with my eyes and my own expression. \u0026ldquo;Guys, stop talking nonsense and get down to business. Ahem!\u0026rdquo; At the end, I pointed my voice and coughed.\nThe killer hastily turned off the intercom.\n\u0026ldquo;You got a cold?\u0026rdquo; He asked.\nI deliberately put on a hard face and nodded in gesture.\nAlso have to be thankful that the killer did not find the end. And at this point, what I wanted most was for the beard to understand what I really meant.\nJust before, when the murderer talked to everyone on the intercom, I secretly observed the scene outside the window.\nDirectly outside the window was a crooked-necked tree. This is simply too marked.\nThere is a dumpling restaurant in Baoshan County that sells dumplings named a tree! The reason is simple, there is a crooked-necked tree growing in the house of this store.\nAt the time, the store owner had someone look at it and said it was a fortune tree, so not only did not cut, and eventually became its sign.\nBeard and I went to this dumpling store to eat many times. Originally the dumplings are really quite delicious, but the beard and I complained, saying that the waiter here is too unqualified, coughing when serving, that is not her saliva, all sprayed on the dumplings?\nI reassured him then, out of sight, out of mind!\nAnd that cough I just made was imitating the waitress.\nIf he was smart, he would have guessed that I was now in trouble and imprisoned near the \u0026ldquo;one tree\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, beard!\u0026rdquo; I kept praying.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what the murderer\u0026rsquo;s purpose was in capturing me in the first place, but for now, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to kill me, but to talk to me.\nThis is also attributed to my \u0026ldquo;enthusiasm\u0026rdquo;.\nI have an attitude: don\u0026rsquo;t contradict, go along with him, in order to buy all the time!\nI suspect he hadn\u0026rsquo;t spoken to anyone in a long time, so when he opened his mouth, he simply became a talker.\nHe first did a round of emotions: \u0026ldquo;Why is there so much unfairness in this world? Some people are born with a golden spoon, while others are born with a disability and are abandoned by their families, why is that so?\nIf someone is just born to be treacherous and lazy and gluttonous, and therefore abandoned, that also makes people have nothing to say, but those demented people, they do not even have a chance to struggle, why is it so unfair?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he asked me in all seriousness: \u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t we socialists? Aren\u0026rsquo;t we eating a big pot of rice and there is no difference between the rich and the poor? But why doesn\u0026rsquo;t anyone care about them (the demented)?\u0026rdquo;\nIf I were someone else, or if I were free now, I would have told the truth, which is not a bull\u0026rsquo;s-eye or what?\nBut in order to prevent provoking him, I deliberately nodded seriously and responded, \u0026ldquo;You have a point!\u0026rdquo;\nThe killer sighed again and sat down next to me in exhaustion.\n\u0026ldquo;You know what? I wanted to help them so much, even stay with them, ask for food together, and also bring all the good things I have, to them, but it\u0026rsquo;s no use! They\u0026rsquo;ll never be well.\u0026rdquo;\nI was right, the murderer\u0026rsquo;s eyes were red. This murderer, to his surprise, was crying.\n\u0026ldquo;They are animals!\u0026rdquo; He also choked up.\nI saw it with my own eyes, otherwise I would never have believed that the word beast coming out of his mouth was not a derogatory word at all.\nI also suddenly particularly helpless, thinking back, when we all saw the handwriting at the scene, who would have thought that the word beast, this meaning?\nI adjusted my mood and interjected again tentatively, \u0026ldquo;You played them the tape because you wanted to cure them?\u0026rdquo;\nThe killer smiled bitterly. I took this as a reply.\nBut the boy turned over his face faster than a book. All of a sudden, his anger was so strong: \u0026ldquo;That fake, thanks to his name Zhang Jianjun! Is he worthy of it! I worshipped this qigong master with the same name as me and had high hopes, but he lied to me! Especially that poor guy (the first deceased), after he heard the tape, he actually disliked me, saying that I was not good to him and let him listen to this kind of disgusting baloney!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you killed this guy?\u0026rdquo; I asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It was relief! I didn\u0026rsquo;t want him to suffer so much anymore, like a beast. Since I can\u0026rsquo;t find a cure anymore, instead of that, I\u0026rsquo;ll use my way and give him a relief.\u0026rdquo;\nHe even gestured up at this point: \u0026ldquo;Cut off the head, this thing is bad, so don\u0026rsquo;t want it. As for the body, hang them up and let them ascend to heaven. I believe they will be reincarnated in the next life! Don\u0026rsquo;t you think so?\u0026rdquo;\nI actually wanted to vomit and felt disgusted by his twisted thinking, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help it, I played hard to calm down and nodded \u0026ldquo;hypocritically\u0026rdquo;.\nNext he kept cursing the qigong master named Zhang Jianjun.\nI also understood that the reason he buried the murder weapon and human head in the yard of the qigong master, is to \u0026ldquo;tell\u0026rdquo; the qigong master one thing: his qigong useless, and the bad thing (head), he also disliked, simply give the qigong master.\nI counted in my heart that the master had disappeared for half a month. Although the current look, he is more than lucky, but I still asked: \u0026ldquo;Do you know where that Zhang Jianjun went?\u0026rdquo;\nThe killer patted my shoulder, as if to say, you asked a very good question!\nHe replied, \u0026ldquo;I know the police are taking good care of him. But I found an opportunity to take him captive. Originally I told him that people are not afraid to make mistakes, as long as they can repent. So I asked him to come with me to \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; demented people, but I never thought he would dare to resist such a good advice from me. Especially after originally agreeing to it for three days, he suddenly backtracked. Thanks to me for treating him as a friend and giving him the good stuff! This liar who is not what he seems, so I later decided, again, to tie a stone to his feet and throw him in the pond to feed the fish. This kind of person, not worthy of ascension, or feed the fish, at least the fish have grown fat, we eat when there is a mouthful of well!\u0026rdquo;\nSpeaking of this, he looked at me again, took out a face confused expression: \u0026ldquo;I finally left a note, specifically told you ah, that Zhang Jianjun is in the pond. But I look at the news and newspapers in the past few days, why there is Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s search notice? So that night, I went back to look at it, I did not expect \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe covered his mouth and laughed: \u0026ldquo;You guys even used the pump to pump the pond. Really stupid, at that time I deliberately left a blood trail, so that it extends to the pond. In fact, you guys just need to cast a net there and fish a few times, you will be able to find Zhang Jianjun\u0026rsquo;s body, well \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; maybe it has turned into a skeleton. Also the heads of the three ascendants, all bad stuff anyway! All were left there by me. Actually fished up really effortlessly!\u0026rdquo;\nI listened frozen. Also recalled the picture at the scene of the crime, the note that said: come find me, Zhang Jianjun!\nBut who would have thought that the meaning of this note is so.\nThe next half an hour, I continued to chat along with the killer. And he, in fact, more and more favorable to me, and even come up with a look of regret, saying that it would be good to know me early, because he and I are in many ways heroes where slightly the same.\nI smiled on the surface, but in my heart there is a feeling of crying, there is a moment, I dislike myself a little, said with this kind of person like-minded.\nAnd this kind of acting against your will, very painful. If the beard did not appear, I do not know how long I can hold on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nSuddenly, the house door was kicked open.\nIn fact, the killer reacted quickly, the moment the door was broken, he bounced up like a panther.\nAs for me, I also seized this one opportunity. Although they are tied, but do not forget that the mouth is not sealed.\nWhat time is it, what are the rules? I leaned forward with all my might and bit his wrist holding the iron hook.\n\u0026ldquo;Bastard!\u0026rdquo; He cursed in pain, and kicked me hard.\nLike a potato, I rolled to the side. But such a delay bought time for the beard who took the brunt of the attack.\n\u0026ldquo;Damn it, dare to hit the old leather!\u0026rdquo; He cursed and lunged forward.\nI was worried that he would not lose, after all, the killer had a weapon. But this worry seems superfluous.\nWho was Beard? Once the prison\u0026rsquo;s big oil!\nNot a few moves it, the beard will ride the murderer in the crotch, that is, I shouted in time, otherwise the beard\u0026rsquo;s fist, certainly hit the murderer\u0026rsquo;s right temple.\nIt is clear that the beard for me, this time to death!\nBut in the end, the murderer\u0026rsquo;s neck swelled up a cut, he also completely fainted.\nThe bearded man\u0026rsquo;s body lurched and slid off the murderer.\nHe looked at me, and I looked at him.\nHe deliberately coughed and he laughed.\nAugust 15, 1993.\nIt lasted a whole month and a half before the case was finally solved.\nBut the beard and I did not have the opportunity to participate in its follow-up, when Yunnan staged a major event, the local police force is insufficient, the police asked for help from the provinces.\nThe two of us were arranged by Ma Sanshui, rushed to Yunnan overnight.\nI guess many people have heard of that case later, known as the \u0026ldquo;black man hotel series of murders\u0026rdquo;.\nThat case, not here to describe one by one, but the case of Zhang Jianjun, I later listened to other eyes and ears and introduced some of the situation. It is said that Zhang Jianjun, this person, since childhood, has a \u0026ldquo;temper\u0026rdquo;, playing games with his friends, everyone must listen to him, regardless of what he said right or wrong, or he will not be happy, and even fight with those who do not obey.\nAfter elementary school, there was an art class, the teacher asked everyone to draw a horse, Zhang Jianjun actually drew a thing that was not a cow or a horse, the teacher said he was wrong, he retorted in class, saying that this was the horse in his heart. Finally, when everyone in the class laughed at him, he was so angry that he tore up the painting that he had drawn for one class.\nAt the age of 18, Zhang Jianjun was in the army. In fact, he is a soldier material, all aspects are outstanding, even the instructor evaluation, he is suitable for special forces.\nThe problem is, he also has a shortcoming, not only do not obey orders, but also always looking for instructors to ask some strange and bizarre questions. For example, what he couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand was: why are there so many people becoming soldiers? Now there is no war, the soldiers only drill every day, what a waste of manpower? Why don\u0026rsquo;t we cut back and send most of the soldiers home and let them serve the community?\nIn fact, his eccentric thinking since childhood, but also destined to his path is increasingly narrow. Especially after he changed jobs from the military, he was further isolated.\nHe has changed many jobs, basically for his own personal reasons. Because of this, he always felt that he was being unfairly treated, and even this view was, step by step, amplified to demented people.\nHe became more and more sympathetic to the demented person, and with his distorted thinking, he also wanted to make the demented person live a normal life again with his own efforts. For example, take the demented person to seek medical treatment. But this brain disease, how can be cured?\nFinally, he put his hope on the qigong masters, especially in Baoshan County, there is a qigong master with the same name as him, this person is very famous, and even some tabloid news that this person has also cured cancer.\nZhang Jianjun for this reason, writing letters, trying to visit, etc., but the master, a face of superiority and arrogance, simply do not see him. Finally Zhang Jianjun could only buy tapes, after all, the qigong master said, the tape with his gong power, can also cure the disease.\nAnd the next early one morning, looking at the demented person did not get better at all, Zhang Jianjun completely disappointed, under the influence of distorted thinking, he also used his own method, the demented person freed, went to heaven \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nAbout this person, Zhang Jianjun, after my beard and I went to Yunnan, we also had several private discussions.\nOf course, in addition to discussing him, we also play on the topic, and finally talk about \u0026ldquo;fairness\u0026rdquo;. After all, Zhang Jianjun before being shot, are shouting, saying that this society is unfair to him!\nHu Zi does not like to hide, expressed his views: \u0026ldquo;What do you mean by fairness? What do you mean by unfair? In fact, there is no absolute fairness? Like us, we made a big mistake back then, and now in order to cleanse the soul of the last dirty soil, so become the eyes and ears, almost every day to face, to do with criminals and life and death struggle. In fact, is it easy for us? Is it fair to us? When the mistake was made before, if there is a person to pull us a hand, let us hang on the horse, it will not follow so nagging? But \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe beard thought of what, suddenly happy ha ha laughed: \u0026ldquo;I still say, this society is good, and will get better and better, but anyone who is born in this world, but also have to be prepared for a psychological. No matter where in this world, there is no absolute fairness, so do not give up the right to live because of \u0026lsquo;unfairness\u0026rsquo;, and we should not give up the pursuit of happiness because of it.\u0026rdquo;\nLook at the beard continue to continuous river torrent of the momentum.\nI deliberately coughed a few times.\nWe both seemed to think of something else and both laughed together.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/90niandaidaanxilie5/","summary":"I wiggled up frantically. This caught the attention of the killer, Zhang Jianjun.\nHe temporarily turned off the intercom and asked me again, \u0026ldquo;Where are you not feeling well? Do you want to sleep again.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter saying that, he took out a pocket, took out a plastic bag, which was sealed with a white handkerchief.\nWhich I do not understand, immediately shook his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Then what did you just wave?","title":"The Headless Corpse on the Flagpole, Section 3 (Qigong Masters)"}]
