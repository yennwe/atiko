At that time, I was still in junior high school, and every night at dinner time, the TV would play a domestic criminal investigation drama, the specific name of the drama now can not remember, only remember that there are a lot of such as \u0026ldquo;extract evidence back to the laboratory to check\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;decent scientific analysis\u0026rdquo; and such unexplained scenes, the main object of examination is the bones, fingerprints, blood, etc., at that time, I felt that this work is really high-end. At that time, the Internet was not yet convenient, and without knowing more about the situation, I set myself the ideal of \u0026ldquo;to be such a forensic scientist\u0026rdquo;. Now I look back and think, this is not forensics! It was a hodgepodge of various branches of forensic science and trace inspection work, and in some places it was seriously out of touch with reality.\nWhen the college entrance examination, originally because of their own interest in mathematics, physics is pathetic, for biology, medical aspects is very much like, think to study medicine it. However, I was already very uncomfortable with the bad doctor-patient relationship, and I was tired of thinking about it. Although I remembered my dream of forensic medicine, I also thought that \u0026ldquo;forensic medicine is just contacting dead people\u0026rdquo;, and finally entered the pure engineering major of electrical information through various misunderstandings.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the first week of college, and the high math and physics could kill me a hundred times. I remembered my \u0026ldquo;forensic dream\u0026rdquo; again. Through communication with teachers and seniors, interviews, and attending professional courses, I firmly decided that I must study forensics. Luckily, the school had a policy of transferring majors, and I successfully transferred to the forensic science program.\nAfter so many years of personal experience in forensic science, I realized that there are so many things that people do not understand about this profession when they often ask me with hesitation or confusion. Out of my love for forensics, I started to popularize forensics on the Internet, hoping that more people would understand the real forensics, so that some unscientific and incorrect perceptions could be deciphered and this mysterious profession could be presented more realistically in front of everyone. This is also in order to leave a little trace, to those who also have a dream like me back then, but no way to understand the children some modest help.\nBecause of my work, I always try to avoid touching cases in my writing, and I always try to use simple and straightforward life language to explain the professional content. I have to admit that it is easy to feel boring, and even if the cute and amusing style of writing is interesting, it can only be used as a spice occasionally, but it will become boring after reading too much.\nTherefore, this time I received an invitation to write an e-book, and after careful consideration, I intend to show the practical application of forensic knowledge through some specific cases: I say \u0026ldquo;cases\u0026rdquo;, but in fact it is just a short story. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;art comes from life and is higher than life\u0026rdquo;, my poor writing is not much of an art, but the truth is the same, that is.\nThe storyline involved in this article is presented through artificial processing and fiction, in which the time, names of people, places, and details are fictitious. The world is full of surprises and coincidences are not surprising, so please do not take them with reality.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/1.xiezaiqianmian/","summary":"Death is often seen as obscure and horrific, and various perceptions have arisen around it, both scientific and superstitious.
