At that time, the Internet was not yet convenient, and without knowing more about the situation, I set myself the ideal of \u0026ldquo;to be such a forensic scientist\u0026rdquo;. Now I look back and think, this is not forensics! It was a hodgepodge of various branches of forensic science and trace inspection work, and in some places it was seriously out of touch with reality.\nWhen the college entrance examination, originally because of their own interest in mathematics, physics is pathetic, for biology, medical aspects is very much like, think to study medicine it. However, I was already very uncomfortable with the bad doctor-patient relationship, and I was tired of thinking about it. Although I remembered my dream of forensic medicine, I also thought that \u0026ldquo;forensic medicine is just contacting dead people\u0026rdquo;, and finally entered the pure engineering major of electrical information through various misunderstandings.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the first week of college, and the high math and physics could kill me a hundred times. I remembered my \u0026ldquo;forensic dream\u0026rdquo; again. Through communication with teachers and seniors, interviews, and attending professional courses, I firmly decided that I must study forensics. Luckily, the school had a policy of transferring majors, and I successfully transferred to the forensic science program.\nAfter so many years of personal experience in forensic science, I realized that there are so many things that people do not understand about this profession when they often ask me with hesitation or confusion. Out of my love for forensics, I started to popularize forensics on the Internet, hoping that more people would understand the real forensics, so that some unscientific and incorrect perceptions could be deciphered and this mysterious profession could be presented more realistically in front of everyone. This is also in order to leave a little trace, to those who also have a dream like me back then, but no way to understand the children some modest help.\nBecause of my work, I always try to avoid touching cases in my writing, and I always try to use simple and straightforward life language to explain the professional content. I have to admit that it is easy to feel boring, and even if the cute and amusing style of writing is interesting, it can only be used as a spice occasionally, but it will become boring after reading too much.\nTherefore, this time I received an invitation to write an e-book, and after careful consideration, I intend to show the practical application of forensic knowledge through some specific cases: I say \u0026ldquo;cases\u0026rdquo;, but in fact it is just a short story. As the saying goes, \u0026ldquo;art comes from life and is higher than life\u0026rdquo;, my poor writing is not much of an art, but the truth is the same, that is.\nThe storyline involved in this article is presented through artificial processing and fiction, in which the time, names of people, places, and details are fictitious.

Write in front"},{"content":"But all the things in this world, there is a first time. Some first time is nervous and excited, some first time is surprised and happy, some first time is sad and hard to suppress. In my case, my first contact with forensic work, but with the above-mentioned common feelings are not quite the same.\nMy first real exposure to forensic work was in the summer after my freshman year. At that time, I contacted the director of forensic medicine of the Public Security Bureau, who would assign us to internship units, through my senior, and asked him to arrange a unit for me to experience forensic work first. So, I came to a public security bureau as a small follower, and began the work of \u0026ldquo;trainee forensics\u0026rdquo;.\nThe first day, the director threw me a \u0026ldquo;forensic pathology\u0026rdquo; for me to read, because only freshman year, from the study of these specialized courses is still early, in fact, is also to read a plausible understanding of the. At night, in order not to miss the rare opportunity to learn, I chose to stay in the unit and asked the seniors on duty that day to call me if something came up. However, for several days in a row, it was \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo;, and the feeling of not being able to sleep with something in mind was really unpleasant.\nOne day, I finally waited for the first scene of my life, but in the excitement, I did not expect the first scene was quite heavy.\nThat morning at 5 o\u0026rsquo;clock, I was sleeping in the dark, the pillow phone suddenly rang. I got up from bed with a jolt and grabbed the phone to find that it was the director on duty that day, telling me to gather downstairs and have a scene.\nI quickly got up and dressed, too slow to wait for the elevator, directly from the stairs to the downstairs. But I was the only one downstairs with the chirping crickets, and I waited a few minutes before I saw the director come out with two people yawning. They expressed great appreciation for my positive, while separately recalling the passion of the year when they first joined the workforce - \u0026ldquo;young people are just energetic ah\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;really old hello\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nThe scene of the incident was located in the urban-rural area, in front of a street store on the sidewalk of a road. When we arrived at the scene, there were a lot of onlookers gathered around, the first police station to arrive at the alarm has pulled a cordon, while trying to get the onlookers to disperse, but it did not help.\n\u0026ldquo;The first thing to do is to go to the trunk and carry a survey box out. The director explained to me, and then got out of the car to understand the situation.\nI picked up a large box with \u0026ldquo;forensic scene investigation\u0026rdquo; printed on it, bent over the police line and went inside. Thinking about this kind of thing in the past, I can only be a spectator outside, but this time I was able to walk in as a staff member with a cool case in hand, I could feel the eyes of many onlookers around me and the case in my hand, this feeling of being noticed is really great!\nApproaching the scene, first see is a propped open on the ground red umbrella, umbrella below is a bed quilt, can vaguely see a person under the quilt, around the ground scattered with some red and white things, there is a woolen hat covered in the ground. A middle-aged woman who claimed to be the daughter of the deceased said while crying: \u0026ldquo;In the morning \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I just got up \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; on \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; heard downstairs \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;someone downstairs shouting \u0026lsquo;dead people\u0026rsquo;, I lay down the window to look at \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; saw a person wearing my mother\u0026rsquo;s clothes lying on the ground \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; I came down to see that it was my mother\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;Mom ah \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; why do you want to jump to your death ah!\nWhile the colleagues of the site survey are taking photos to fix the scene, I opened the survey box, took out gloves and handed a pair to the director, he also wore a good pair. When the photos were taken, the director walked up and lifted the woolen hat on the ground first, under the hat is also a puddle of red and white things, a bit like red oil bean flowers look like, the crowd saw this scene issued a gasp.\n\u0026ldquo;This is brain tissue.\u0026rdquo; The director said to me while squatting next to the corpse, \u0026ldquo;Be prepared for a while.\nThe director was just about to move away from the umbrella when the daughter of the deceased rushed over to stop us: \u0026ldquo;The deceased cannot show their faces to the sun! I muttered in my heart \u0026ldquo;What kind of feudal superstitious ideas are these? I looked at the director at the same time.\nThe director stood up and said to the daughter of the deceased, \u0026ldquo;We understand your feelings, but now we have to check the situation to determine how your mother died, what if someone killed your mother? The director went back and forth many times, but the daughter of the deceased just kept repeating \u0026ldquo;A deceased person cannot show his face to the sun!\nDirector to see the communication is not very smooth, called the police first to the daughter of the deceased to the side to record the situation, and then turned to me and said: \u0026ldquo;You play umbrella to her cover, the quilt first lift a little, I first look at the situation. I squatted down, holding an umbrella in one hand, and lifted a corner of the quilt on the ground with the other.\nUnderneath the quilt was a distorted blood-stained face, and on closer inspection, the blood was interspersed with white brain tissue. The director touched the corpse\u0026rsquo;s head and whispered to me: \u0026ldquo;Look at this head has been deformed, I feel there are many more fractures, the left side of this large piece of scalp cracked such a large mouth \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he said as he poked his fingers in. \u0026ldquo;Well \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; deep into the skull, the brain tissue is coming out of here.\u0026rdquo; The director then began to examine the ribs and limbs, the deceased\u0026rsquo;s right elbow twisted into a strange shape under the director\u0026rsquo;s hand, it seems there must be a fracture. The director covered the quilt after the inspection, asked me to put the umbrella back in place, called on me and the daughter of the deceased \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s go up and take a look\u0026rdquo;, and said to go to the door of the unit behind the building.\nThis is a small four-story building, we walked to the fourth floor when we saw a small door above, walked up to find a rooftop, the rooftop has a few color plates built temporary board room, the other side of a vacant lot pulled a few wire, above drying a few pieces of clothing. The daughter of the deceased came over to us and pointed out: \u0026ldquo;My mother lives in that room over there. I saw that the trace survey colleagues are taking pictures and checking the ground, went over and took a look at the probe: the room is a little too much stuff, but it\u0026rsquo;s still neat and tidy, feeling nothing obvious.\n\u0026ldquo;Come and take pictures!\u0026rdquo; I heard the director\u0026rsquo;s voice and looked back to find that the director had gone to the rooftop fence, there was a small bench overturned by the wall, the director poked out half of his body to look down and was calling for people to come over and take pictures. I also went over the probe to look outside and found that this position is exactly to the dead below, but did not find any other special problems. The director reached out to stop me when I wanted to probe a little farther.\n\u0026ldquo;Be careful not to rub! Look what\u0026rsquo;s here!\u0026rdquo; The director pointed to a spot on the fence that I had just immediately brushed against.\n\u0026ldquo;Are these \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; footprints?\u0026rdquo; I followed the director\u0026rsquo;s hand to look at the fence, but found a vague and not very obvious traces, change the angle of observation, and found that it looks like the sole of the forefoot pattern like traces.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a footprint. Now tell me what you think.\u0026rdquo; The director looked at me and said.\nI thought about it: \u0026ldquo;The deceased should have jumped from here!\nThe director nodded: \u0026ldquo;Well, a small part of it is right. But there is a detail you did not notice, you look outside again on the eaves what?\nOnce again, I looked out and saw that outside the rooftop was a small eave made of glazed tiles, only sticking out about 10 cm, and a small piece of dust had been rubbed off the eave, revealing the clean tiles underneath.\n\u0026ldquo;If the man jumped, why would the dust on the eaves be rubbed off?\nSeeing my face confused, the director went on to say: \u0026ldquo;You are just now in contact with these, it is normal to think not understand. The deceased is a very old lady, just now when I checked I found that her body muscle atrophy is very serious, which indicates that she died before a long period of bed rest, the body should be quite weak. She can climb this fence is already very difficult, where there is strength to \u0026lsquo;jump\u0026rsquo; down? And you see where she was lying on the ground is not much farther from the eaves of the house, so she should have climbed the fence and then slid down head first, against the eaves.\n\u0026ldquo;Director, then how did you determine that she slipped headfirst and was not picked up and thrown? I asked a question.\nThe director praised: \u0026ldquo;Very good! You are thinking very carefully. You look around the ground is very rough concrete, this ground is difficult to leave obvious footprints, and this is next to the drying clothes, there are footprints in addition to the dead is not surprising. But this small bench and the edge of the platform are only a footprint, looks very similar pattern, so I presume that the deceased stepped on the small bench that fell over, climbing the fence themselves. As for why the head down, you say it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well! I just read in the book you gave me yesterday that \u0026rsquo;there is a close relationship between the part of the ground and the injury received\u0026rsquo;. I spoke carefully while watching the director\u0026rsquo;s face, and found that he was slowly nodding his head, so I gained some more confidence. I continued: \u0026ldquo;We just saw the injuries to the head and limbs of the deceased below were obvious, so you presumed that it should be a head-down fall.\n\u0026ldquo;Very good! We need to combine all kinds of phenomena and detailed information in our forensic practice, which requires a lot of practice to accumulate experience, and we should often do this kind of thinking by heart. The director showed a little smile, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go, we did not find anything unusual, it should be the old lady\u0026rsquo;s own suicide. Let\u0026rsquo;s go ask the family again to see what they say.\u0026rdquo;\nWe found the daughter of the deceased again, we explained to her what we thought, and the daughter also said her guesses. It turns out that the old lady has not been in good health, more than half a year ago was diagnosed with cancer, in order to cure the disease sold the house but nothing, after spending all the savings is even no place to live, desperate under the only way to relatives, relatives can not live, on the roof of the building built a temporary house to live. After this, the old lady\u0026rsquo;s health is worse every day.\nThe daughter of the deceased looked at the place where her mother had lived and finally said, \u0026ldquo;My mother didn\u0026rsquo;t want to keep dragging us down, right?\nThis was my first time on the scene, my first time seeing a real death.\nAlthough freshman year in school just after learning anatomy, have seen the corpse, but also hands-on autopsy contact, but after all, it is a formalin-treated corpse, although the first time I saw the heart still shocked, but a semester down to get used to it, it is only as ordinary as the daily see the teacher. But this time I actually saw the death around me, and I personally felt the grief of the family.\nOn the way back, the chief saw me sitting in the car and said, \u0026ldquo;This is the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve seen such a scene, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? The police is a grounded job and can see the dark side of society. We are the police when the forensic is to see the people and things related to life and death, the death of a person ah, a lot of human feelings and warmth will come out. If you also come to public security as a forensic scientist, you will encounter more dark, negative things, you have to learn to keep yourself a clear heart ah.\nI am now working, although not a police officer, but also a forensic scientist. I have always taken to heart what the director said back then, and have been trying to practice it.\n","permalink":"https://yanwe.win/post/2.fayishengyadediyicixianchang/","summary":"But all the things in this world, there is a first time.
