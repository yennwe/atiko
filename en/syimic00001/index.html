    <p>Chapter 1: Model Couple</p>
<p>On the day of the beginning of spring, Xiangcheng experienced a substantial snowfall, and the biting wind stung the face, making it painfully cold.</p>
<p>Exiting the art gallery, Gu Shisheng opened his phone only to find a message from his husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[It&rsquo;s snowing, and it&rsquo;s cold. I asked Uncle Zhou to pick you up. The project will end in two days, and we can go to Nancheng to see the sea together.]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng replied with a slow &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no immediate response from the other side, indicating he was likely busy.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng and his husband, Lu Siyi, had known each other since high school, a relationship that had lasted for ten years. No one would have expected that the once ordinary and sickly Gu Shisheng would end up with Lu Siyi.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng lowered his gaze. Uncle Zhou arrived quickly, but Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s head was still dusted with a layer of white frost.</p>
<p>Apologizing, Uncle Zhou said, &ldquo;Hurry, get in the car. The road is a bit congested. Don&rsquo;t catch a cold, Mr. Lu would worry later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m robust.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng patted off the snow from his head before getting into the car. His beautiful lashes trembled slightly, and his complexion turned porcelain due to the cold.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng had been frail and sickly in his early years, but these years of being pampered by Lu Siyi had improved his health.</p>
<p>In the car, he habitually huddled by the window.</p>
<p>Observing the somewhat delicate young man in the rearview mirror, Uncle Zhou, with a hint of regret, said, &ldquo;Mr. Lu, you arrived quickly. However, Mr. Lu might worry about you catching a cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine; I&rsquo;m healthy.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng casually brushed off the layer of white snow from his head before sighing, &ldquo;Go to Yulan Bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yulan Bay was a property Gu Shisheng had bought a few years ago. He remembered it two years ago and occasionally stayed there for a couple of days.</p>
<p>Uncle Zhou acknowledged and drove steadily to Yulan Bay.</p>
<p>Opening the door to the apartment, Gu Shisheng immediately caught the aroma of a meal. His features softened, and he hung his coat in the entrance, changing into slippers as he entered.</p>
<p>There was movement in the kitchen, and the TV was still on, playing a variety show.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng leaned on the sofa.</p>
<p>As the kitchen sounds ceased, a young man emerged holding a bowl of noodles, looking surprised at Gu Shisheng. His eyes then lit up with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gu, why didn&rsquo;t you say you were coming?&rdquo; He hurriedly checked his phone.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng spoke, &ldquo;Just came over to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe placed the bowl in front of Gu Shisheng, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect Mr. Gu to come today. I just made some noodles. You can eat this first. I&rsquo;ll make something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need, this is fine.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng picked up the chopsticks and, remembering something, furrowed his brows slightly. He looked at Shen Qinghe and said, &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s trial results are out. How is Auntie doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe&rsquo;s mother had gone through trials due to the actions of his father. Despite the unpleasant situation, she seemed to be handling it well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing well, but she&rsquo;s not used to it here. I&rsquo;ll send her back to our hometown in a few days.&rdquo; Shen Qinghe replied with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, let me know when you do. I&rsquo;ll go visit Auntie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe still found it surreal. He had grown up in a household filled with violence and indifference, enduring daily beatings from his gambling-addicted father and witnessing his weak mother&rsquo;s helpless cries. After desperately escaping the destitute village and arriving in Xiangcheng, he was exposed to the vast world outside. However, being a penniless youth made survival difficult. Gu Shisheng found him, sent him back to school, and cared for him.</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe had once asked Gu Shisheng why he picked up someone as dirty and beggar-like as him.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng, with a casual gaze, replied, &ldquo;Hmm? Because you remind me of myself from a long, long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe didn&rsquo;t believe it. Perhaps it was just a whimsical thought of Gu Shisheng. He was like a clean and sacred cloud in the sky, not a dirty thing in the mud!</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng didn&rsquo;t eat much, but his stomach felt warmer. Shen Qinghe washed the dishes, returned, and lay down with Gu Shisheng to watch TV. He turned his head, and his gaze fell on Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s delicate lips. Expectant and nervous, he spoke, &ldquo;Mr. Gu, tonight&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng felt a bit tired, leaning against Shen Qinghe, &ldquo;Tonight, I&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold me over.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng extended his hand, meeting the restrained excitement in Shen Qinghe&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Graceful and passionate.</p>
<p>Even Gu Shisheng couldn&rsquo;t help but tilt his head, kissing the youth&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>He began to understand the joy his husband found in being with those lovers.</p>
<p>It was exhilarating and refreshing‚Äîno one could deny the happiness.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Lu Siyi returned a day earlier.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng had just sent Shen Qinghe&rsquo;s mother to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My family has troubled you. Thanks to you these years. If Qinghe doesn&rsquo;t do well in any aspect, just tell me.&rdquo; The woman chattered, humble and sincere.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s gaze remained calm. &ldquo;Qinghe is excellent; you can rest assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phone rang, and Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s brows twitched slightly when he saw the caller ID. After exchanging a few words with Shen Qinghe, he went to the side to answer the call.</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe&rsquo;s mother tugged at Shen Qinghe&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qinghe, tell Mom, are you doing this voluntarily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe nervously lowered his gaze. &ldquo;Mom, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen&rsquo;s mother sighed softly. &ldquo;Do you think you can hide it from me? Mom has seen many men and marriages over here. I&rsquo;m not an old-fashioned person, but your father&rsquo;s affairs and those expensive clothes&hellip; Qinghe, if you&rsquo;re with Mr. Gu to cheat money, we can&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s a sinful thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, I haven&rsquo;t cheated Mr. Gu.&rdquo; Shen Qinghe sighed helplessly.</p>
<p>Shen&rsquo;s mother finally relaxed and then smiled, &ldquo;Well, if you and Mr. Gu are together, you must treat him well. Don&rsquo;t let Mr. Gu suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen Qinghe wanted to smile but couldn&rsquo;t. Make Mr. Gu suffer?</p>
<p>He thought of the yearning and waiting day and night, the relationship sustained by money, and a few days ago when Gu Shisheng suddenly asked if he liked someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, we will be fine. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; He suppressed the remaining bitterness.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng answered the call and heard his husband&rsquo;s concerned tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back. Aunt Qin said you haven&rsquo;t been home these two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back now. I&rsquo;ve been staying at Domain Bay for two days. It&rsquo;s closer. I&rsquo;m coming back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s far, let the driver take you. Did you skip breakfast again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His husband&rsquo;s tone was indulgent. Lu Siyi, once a playboy in his youth, became more stable after work, especially gentle and accommodating towards Gu Shisheng. Seven years of marriage, and they had never had a fight.</p>
<p>Everyone praised them as a model couple.</p>
<p>A young couple across the street held hands, biting into the same ice cream.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng bit his lip. &ldquo;I ate. Don&rsquo;t worry only about me. You work hard too. Without you, Lu Corporation would fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, wife, I&rsquo;ll come pick you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. You just got back. Get some good rest. I&rsquo;ll be home soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng couldn&rsquo;t let Lu Corporation see Shen Qinghe. It would be uncomfortable for everyone.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng hung up the phone, and Shen Qinghe&rsquo;s mother had just gotten into the car. He drove Shen Qinghe to school.</p>
