    <p>Chapter 17: Taking Advantage of Someone&rsquo;s Misfortune, Shameless Act</p>
<p>Under the influence of alcohol, Gu Shisheng found a pavilion to sit in. The Lu family estate was vast, with many courtyards and pavilions, exuding a classical and aristocratic charm. Bamboo was planted in the courtyard, and under the moonlight, it created a faint and elegant scene. The sound of a few insects in the woods disturbed a pair of moths, causing them to flutter over the surface of the lake by the pavilion, creating ripples.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng, feeling dizzy, gazed at the lake as if it were a mirror. Rolling up his sleeves, he leaned on the edge of the pavilion, reaching out to touch the reflected light on the water.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi didn&rsquo;t run far before turning back. He remembered Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s injured ankle, bleeding, and the fact that he was carrying a bottle of alcohol. In the middle of the night, it was unsafe to be intoxicated.</p>
<p>Indeed, he was only concerned about the safety of a regular friend, not wanting to meet again.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi, frustrated and feeling helpless, hated himself for falling for a married man at first sight. He couldn&rsquo;t express the stifling feeling, and compared to Gu Shisheng, who possessed an unparalleled temperament, any beauty that rivaled him lacked his unique charm. It was a strange metaphysics that Jiang Chaoxi couldn&rsquo;t comprehend. In the past, he wouldn&rsquo;t have thought he would ever like someone like Gu Shisheng - gentle, quiet, and steady.</p>
<p>In his youth, full of aspirations, arrogance, and self-pride, he used to say that he would marry the most unique person in the world. But now, Gu Shisheng was the unique one.</p>
<p>But Gu Shisheng belonged to someone else.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi, with red eyes, felt like giving up. He couldn&rsquo;t control his steps and, turning around, he saw Gu Shisheng leaning by the lake.</p>
<p>In the vast expanse of the lake, the slender figure by the shore looked fragile, as if it would be taken away by the lake monsters in the next moment. However, he seemed unconcerned, almost leaning half of his body out.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi was scared.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t dare to shout, afraid of startling Gu Shisheng. Surprisingly, he moved faster than expected. When he embraced the person around the waist, he finally calmed down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gu Shisheng, are you trying to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned the person around, Gu Shisheng moaned and turned, his face pale like jade with a touch of red due to alcohol. At this moment, his misty blue eyes were filled with confusion and watery colors, perhaps because of discomfort, emitting soft moans intermittently from his slightly parted thin lips. He looked fragile and helpless, as if he had been played with and broken.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi was stunned, his mind was a bit hot, and his body was getting warmer. Young people were always susceptible to temptation, especially when facing the beloved White Moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gu&hellip; Gu ge, wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng was drunk, in a daze, and powerless. He couldn&rsquo;t summon any strength and leaned into Jiang Chaoxi.</p>
<p>The scent of alcohol mixed with Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s unique fragrance wafted into Jiang Chaoxi&rsquo;s nostrils. He looked down at the teary-eyed person in his arms, weak and frail. At this moment, all the moral constraints, feelings of guilt, and bottom lines turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi lowered his head and kissed the slightly parted lips. The sweet scent of alcohol passed through, and Jiang Chaoxi tightened his grip on the slender waist, turning the kiss into a more passionate wave that surged layer by layer.</p>
<p>As Gu Shisheng, who had tasted pain, seemed to wake up a bit, he took a step back and was pushed back.</p>
<p>The moon darkened a bit as clouds entwined it. The playful clouds seemed to have achieved their goal and continued to wrap around, making the whole sky dark. The crescent moon pitifully showed a small angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh&hellip; Husband, it hurts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sweet and tangy breath lingered between their lips and teeth. In the dim night, Jiang Chaoxi became aware of himself. He let go of Gu Shisheng, lowered his head, and gently regulated his breath. When he saw the bewildered eyes of the person in front of him, who looked even weaker and more helpless, his face turned paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Jiang Chaoxi&rsquo;s mind cooled down, and his heart turned cold.</p>
<p>What had he done?</p>
<p>How could he take advantage of someone&rsquo;s misfortune?</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi couldn&rsquo;t tolerate what he had done. Though he didn&rsquo;t listen to admonitions, he still had a bottom line of morality and principles. At this moment, he felt extremely malicious, worse than those women who seduced his father.</p>
<p>At least those women were mutually willing, but what about him? He was taking advantage of someone&rsquo;s misfortune, being disgusting, and shameless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gu Shisheng, I really like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a slightly tearful tone, Jiang Chaoxi confessed, only daring to speak to the intoxicated and unclear-minded person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, I won&rsquo;t see you again, Gu Shisheng. I&rsquo;ll find someone better, definitely someone better than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was extremely upset.</p>
<p>In the end, he kissed Gu Shisheng on the forehead, gently and devoutly, as if treating a treasure with a cautious and careful attitude.</p>
<p>Trembling, Jiang Chaoxi helped Gu Shisheng put on his clothes and walked him back. The night wind blew on their heads, a bit cold, but more chilling in the heart. When encountering a maid, Jiang Chaoxi handed the person over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman is drunk, please take him to the rest area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid glanced at her madam and nodded quickly, carefully helping him up.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi dared not look and turned around, saying, &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look too good. Remember to send him a bowl of sobering soup and take good care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo; The maid nodded repeatedly. Since it was Mrs. Lu, she naturally had to take good care of her.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi didn&rsquo;t speak all the way back.</p>
<p>Where did his old man go, he didn&rsquo;t know, but Jiang Chaoxi had to leave this place immediately. He thought just two days ago that he would forget about Gu Shisheng and find someone better.</p>
<p>But at this moment, his heartbeat told him that Jiang Chaoxi, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi couldn&rsquo;t tolerate what he had done. The young man gathered a few friends and went out to let off steam.</p>
<p>The convertible raced on the moonlit road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiang Shao, are we going to the racetrack? It&rsquo;s thrilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi had played before; it was exciting, but he treasured his life. After experiencing the thrilling feeling of playing with his life, Jiang Chaoxi rarely touched it again.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Jiang Chaoxi needed something to release the pressure in his heart.</p>
<p>So he said, &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The racetrack was owned by a friend. There was a race today, and when Jiang Chaoxi arrived, a race had just ended.</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere wasn&rsquo;t great.</p>
<p>It was noisy.</p>
<p>Making Jiang Chaoxi, who was already irritable, feel even worse.</p>
<p>A friend, Lin Song, whispered to Jiang Chaoxi, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a troublemaker. He loses every time he comes to play and causes trouble when he loses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you still let him in?&rdquo; Jiang Chaoxi, without looking, felt annoyed. Why let this sore loser in to spoil the mood?</p>
<p>Lin Song shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it, the other side has a strong influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument on the opposite side ended, and Jiang Chaoxi, feeling bored, was about to turn around but was stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Young Master Jiang? Didn&rsquo;t you go abroad to play the piano? Why are you back? Could it be that you were kicked back for playing badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mocking laughter triggered Jiang Chaoxi&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Jiang Chaoxi turned around, his face tinted with rage. He recognized the person who spoke - the second young master of the Ye family, Ye Kai.</p>
<p>Ye Kai, with a sneer full of malice, continued, &ldquo;I heard you were playing the piano for foreigners abroad. Did you play so badly that you were kicked back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi&rsquo;s eyes glowed with anger. He rushed forward and punched Ye Kai to the ground.</p>
<p>Then, one punch after another, tonight&rsquo;s accumulated anger and malice surged up.</p>
<p>Completely unrestrained and ignoring the surrounding exclamations and dissuasion, Jiang Chaoxi relentlessly continued his assault.</p>
