    <p>Chapter 7: Weariness After the Passage of Time</p>
<p>Several young people, no longer as nervous as before, became more talkative.</p>
<p>Wu Nian and Zheng Sui eagerly sought advice from Gu Shisheng, while Jiang Chaoxi set aside to watch his wife.</p>
<p>His wife&rsquo;s posture with the pen was really pleasing, her voice was pleasant, and she looked even more beautiful when she smiled. What was going on with these two? Was the workplace a place to ask about painting? Instead of studying well at school, they troubled Gu Shisheng here.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi moved a chair closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Gu explains really well. Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t learned to paint. Unlike these two brothers, Jiang Ge can talk about anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement caused a somewhat awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>Wu Nian and Zheng Sui, both straight men, also felt that the tea they had been drinking was a bit strong.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng raised his eyes and looked at Jiang Chaoxi.</p>
<p>The young man looked obedient, with a deceptive face. At the moment, he looked at Gu Shisheng with a hint of grievance.</p>
<p>The slight anomaly in Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s heart turned into self-blame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, if you don&rsquo;t understand anything, you can come and ask me. If you like painting, I can teach you,&rdquo; Gu Shisheng said.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>The excitement of the young man was too obvious, making Gu Shisheng smile as well.</p>
<p>In the evening, Gu Shisheng treated them to dinner, considering it a welcome for the three newcomers, and they gathered at Shenghua Hotel.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was lively, and the people from the gallery were united. Especially since Gu Shisheng didn&rsquo;t have any airs of a leader in his daily life, everyone sitting together didn&rsquo;t feel constrained.</p>
<p>Everyone drank at the dinner table. Gu Shisheng drank a little, not daring to drink too much. He sat in a corner, silent. Because he was often silent, the people who were having fun playing didn&rsquo;t notice the pale color on Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>He self-mockingly thought about going back to be scolded by the doctor.</p>
<p>In his mind, there were countless reasons given to Lu Siyi for not going home.</p>
<p>So, considering it, deceiving someone had too many reasons. Even with repeated occurrences, the guilt didn&rsquo;t remain.</p>
<p>There was no need to tell Lu Siyi about being hospitalized; it was too troublesome. Lu Siyi would worry again. There was no need. He never used to trouble others, but after having Lu Siyi, he began to learn to rely on someone.</p>
<p>Now, Gu Shisheng was learning how not to rely on Lu Siyi.</p>
<p>When we were young, we always felt that the spoken words of a lifetime were romantic and firm. We cannot deny the sincerity of that moment, but it cannot change the weariness that comes after the passage of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a lack of love but weariness.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng curled up on the sofa, his face growing paler. The phone rang, and he stood up to answer it. From the other end came Fu Cheng&rsquo;s furious yelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gu Shisheng, where did you go? Hurry back to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng turned around and saw Jiang Chaoxi in the corridor. The young man, with concern, approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Gu, are you sick? I&rsquo;ll take you to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I can&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whispered, bending over and clutching his stomach.</p>
<p>This sudden change frightened Jiang Chaoxi. However, the young master was still reliable. He picked up Gu Shisheng and walked out.</p>
<p>So light!</p>
<p>Not much weight. Jiang Chaoxi looked down and saw the fine beads of sweat on Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s face due to the pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Gu, hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng still had some consciousness. He supported himself and told Jiang Chaoxi the address of the hospital.</p>
<p>Since Jiang Chaoxi was young, everyone didn&rsquo;t let him drink alcohol. Jiang Chaoxi drove and hurried to the hospital Gu Shisheng mentioned.</p>
<p>After arriving at the hospital, taking painkillers and receiving intravenous fluids, Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s pain gradually eased.</p>
<p>Fu Cheng stood on the side, almost being driven mad by Gu Shisheng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a death wish? Just admitted to the hospital, and you went out to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi stood on the side, now understanding the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Gu, I&rsquo;m sorry. If it weren&rsquo;t for our welcoming banquet&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame yourself. I drank too much.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng remained calm. &ldquo;Thank you for bringing me to the hospital. It&rsquo;s getting late. Go back and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi didn&rsquo;t want to leave. He wanted to stay, but they had just met on the first day. He couldn&rsquo;t make his intentions too obvious. Glancing at Fu Cheng, who was taking care of Gu Shisheng, Jiang Chaoxi couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who this sister is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng laughed lightly. &ldquo;This is my friend and university schoolmate, Fu Cheng. You should call him brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fu Cheng&rsquo;s face didn&rsquo;t look good. However, facing the vigilant but happy eyes of the young man, he immediately understood, looking teasingly at Gu Shisheng lying on the hospital bed.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi felt relieved.</p>
<p>Just a friend would be fine, regardless of whether it was a man or a woman.</p>
<p>After sending Jiang Chaoxi and Fu Cheng away, Gu Shisheng lay quietly. Not long after, he heard the hurried sound of someone entering the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shisheng, I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Siyi was still exuding a chill, still wearing the formal attire from the banquet. Obviously, he had rushed over hastily.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and affectionately placed his hand on Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing major. See, if I had told you, you would have worried.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you promised me before.&rdquo; Whatever happens, let me know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I won&rsquo;t do it again next time.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s tone was gentle.</p>
<p>Lu Siyi was annoyed. &ldquo;What are you apologizing for? Does it still hurt?&rdquo; His hand rested on Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s stomach, as he had already understood all of Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s condition before coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore.&rdquo; Gu Shisheng shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hurt. You should know that you&rsquo;re injured, and it hurts me.&rdquo; He lowered his head, and his forehead touched Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s chest. Gu Shisheng felt the warmth from his chest but didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>He knew that Lu Siyi was blaming himself.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Lu Siyi pulled Gu Shisheng up from hell.</p>
<p>He told him, &ldquo;Gu Shisheng, from now on, as long as I&rsquo;m here, no one can hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had fulfilled that promise.</p>
