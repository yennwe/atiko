    <p>Chapter 16: Those Lovers That Captivate Gu Shisheng</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng wasn&rsquo;t happy. When he stared at Lu Siyi with his misty blue eyes, it didn&rsquo;t seem like anger, but more like grievance.</p>
<p>So, in the end, Lu Siyi always had to compromise.</p>
<p>But this time was different.</p>
<p>Lu Siyi reached out and pinched Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s nose, smiling helplessly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve calculated that I won&rsquo;t do anything to you, right? Let&rsquo;s go; I&rsquo;ll take you upstairs to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Gu Shisheng could speak, he was already lifted by Lu Siyi. With so many people at the banquet, Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s head was a bit dizzy. His first reaction was to get closer to Lu Siyi&rsquo;s chest to shield his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lu Siyi‚Äî&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called his name when he was angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t move around; many people are watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One sentence made Gu Shisheng behave.</p>
<p>Ten years were enough to control a person firmly, especially for Lu Siyi, who knew Gu Shisheng too well.</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi wandered outside and returned to see Lu Siyi carrying someone upstairs.</p>
<p>His old man was still foolishly holding a glass of wine on the side. &ldquo;Young people these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi couldn&rsquo;t help but comment, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re approaching your thirties. You&rsquo;re not much younger than me. Do you have any misconceptions about young people, or do you still think you&rsquo;re young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Senior: &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wine glass in Jiang Senior&rsquo;s hand almost smashed into his son&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>Trembling hands listened to his son&rsquo;s next sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s good about old men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Senior: &ldquo;Get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi didn&rsquo;t leave; he came when he wanted, left when he wanted. There was no such cheap thing as this!</p>
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>Gu Shisheng was carried into the room by Lu Siyi.</p>
<p>He leaned on the bed, and Lu Siyi took off his coat to fetch sobering soup for Gu Shisheng.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng wasn&rsquo;t drunk; he was quite clear-headed. Lu Siyi was just too concerned.</p>
<p>He rubbed his temples, and when he heard the phone ring, he reached out to grab it, realizing he took Lu Siyi&rsquo;s phone by mistake.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng was about to call someone when he heard the voice of a young man on the other end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Lu, I&rsquo;m waiting for you. You promised to compensate me last time. The place you hurt last time still hurts. Be gentler this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng hung up the call.</p>
<p>Stiffening, he didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing. He was about to put down the phone, thought for a moment, and deleted the call record. His face, reddened by alcohol a moment ago, was now unnaturally pale.</p>
<p>The curled eyelashes trembled slightly, and his body shook unnaturally. The deep blue eyes were heavy.</p>
<p>When he heard the sound of Lu Siyi coming back, Gu Shisheng closed his eyes and shrank his body, calming down.</p>
<p>Lu Siyi, holding sobering soup, sat on the edge of the bed. &ldquo;Why is your complexion so bad? Are you feeling unwell?&rdquo; he frowned, sounding nervous.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng opened his eyes and shook his head, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m fine. Maybe I drank too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you admit it earlier?&rdquo; Lu Siyi held the spoon, blew on the soup that had cooled, and fed it to Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s lips. Gu Shisheng drank it sip by sip, not knowing the taste of the soup.</p>
<p>He just marveled at how he seemed to have grown up. From the moment of shock and astonishment just now to now, he quickly calmed down. In controlling emotions, he seemed to be able to do better now.</p>
<p>When Lu Siyi&rsquo;s phone rang again, Gu Shisheng had already finished drinking. He calmly watched Lu Siyi&rsquo;s expression, which stiffened for a moment, and then quickly returned to normal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer the call. Rest for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up and left the master bedroom. His steps were steady, showing no signs of abnormality.</p>
<p>After the sound of Lu Siyi returning, putting on clothes, and touching Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s head, he said, &ldquo;Sleep early. There&rsquo;s something going on at the company. If you don&rsquo;t like it here, you can call Uncle Zhou and have him pick you up directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng opened his eyes. The light on the bedside fell on his face, softening all his edges. &ldquo;Lu Siyi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng remained silent for a moment, then lifted the corners of his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear something warm; it gets cool at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you sleep early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a long, long time, when there was no sound around, Gu Shisheng got up. He couldn&rsquo;t sleep; it seemed like this problem had resurfaced recently.</p>
<p>He searched around and found that he had forgotten to bring the medicine from home.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng picked up a bottle of red wine from the glass cabinet. Holding the wine and a glass, he went outside. He walked toward a quiet place, stepping on the moonlight, step by step. He didn&rsquo;t think about what Lu Siyi was doing now, didn&rsquo;t want to consider right or wrong, and didn&rsquo;t want to think about the teenager ten years ago.</p>
<p>Ironically, he spent five years becoming more indifferent.</p>
<p>Not entirely, otherwise, there wouldn&rsquo;t be Shen Qing.</p>
<p>Five years ago, he would have hysterically asked Lu Siyi why he cheated. Was he not good-looking enough or not stimulating enough? But now, he was even thinking that the soft voice of that person must be very gentle, and his appearance must be good. Lu Siyi had a good eye. Looking at the photos sent to his phone, he found all those people attractive.</p>
<p>He took a few steps and got entangled in the vines by the flowerbed. When he struggled, the vines scratched his ankle.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng squatted down, checking the injured area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, which way is the exit? I can&rsquo;t find the way out. Jiang Ge, right? I can&rsquo;t find the way out. Which way is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiang Chaoxi scratched his head in annoyance. Why would someone build such a big house? After walking around in his own house, he really shouldn&rsquo;t get lost. It was too embarrassing. Finally seeing a person, Jiang Chaoxi spoke up.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng looked up and saw a familiar face.</p>
<p>Four eyes met, and Jiang Chaoxi was stunned.</p>
<p>The man half-squatting raised his jaw because of surprise, and his slightly opened lips were tinged with confusion. Under the moonlight, his fair skin extended to his slender neck, thin and delicate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Gu, why are you here?&rdquo; Jiang Chaoxi spoke first, avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng stood up, still holding the wine bottle, and saw the teenager&rsquo;s awkward and flustered expression. His voice was gentle and mild, &ldquo;Accompanying my husband to attend the banquet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;husband&rsquo; made Jiang Chaoxi&rsquo;s excitement cool down. The pain and entanglement from the unrequited love these days made him unable to bear the embarrassment and turned into anger. &ldquo;It seems that Brother Gu&rsquo;s husband has an extraordinary identity. I waited in the front hall for so long; I should have seen him. But looking at their ages, there were quite a few bald heads. Let me think, Brother Gu&rsquo;s husband is which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Gu Shisheng and, noticing the calm gaze, became even angrier, perhaps angry at his own unrequited love these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth bothering about you. Sooner or later, you will regret it.&rdquo; What was the point of early marriage at such a young age?</p>
<p>After saying that, Jiang Chaoxi walked past Gu Shisheng and even bumped into him to vent his frustration.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng&rsquo;s body trembled for a moment, but he held the wine bottle steadily and turned to look at the young man walking away.</p>
<p>Childish!</p>
<p>But after all, he was only eighteen years old, and his thoughts were simple.</p>
<p>Gu Shisheng didn&rsquo;t care about the ankle that was bleeding. The pain was not significant due to the stimulation of alcohol.</p>
