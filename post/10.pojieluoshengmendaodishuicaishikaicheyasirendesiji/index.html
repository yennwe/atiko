  "articleBody": "We have all seen the crime, kill people and then do their best to conceal the facts of the crime, but who has heard of the race to become a murderer?\n“I’m not going to work tomorrow, it’s great, it’s great! I’m not going to work tomorrow, so I can be as lazy as I want! Listening to the rhythm of the music on my phone, I couldn’t help but hum along. The interesting Sichuan lyrics make me feel close to Chengdu after living there for many years, and more importantly, this song simply sings out my heart now!\nToday is the first day of the National Day holiday, although last night a hundred miles out of a super far site in the middle of the night, almost a sleepless night, rushed back to the autopsy to finish at 7:00 am, but think about a few shifts for colleagues before, and then this holiday will not have to be on duty, can go to a good sleep, a good rest, do not have to guard the phone to be summoned feeling, but still makes me happy.\n“~~~~~”\nThe cell phone of Dr. Sun, who had just finished the autopsy together, rang. He lit up the screen to me, and when I saw the word “director”, I hurriedly paused the music, but I was still immersed in the feeling of “awesome” happiness.\n“Well, it’s me. We just finished the autopsy at midnight last night. Yes! The wife killed her husband and then burned the body. No problem! The head wound was fatal. A titty hammer-like tool was used. Hmm! Okay, okay! All sorts of things were mentioned, so don’t worry Chief!” I listened to Dr. Sun’s answer and knew it was the director who was asking about last night’s case. The autopsy was not difficult, and the case would be solved when the source of the body was found.\n“Ah? What? Another scene? Yeah! I know, we’re on our way!” Dr. Sun’s next answer was a cold shower on my head! I looked at Dr. Sun with disbelief.\nI looked at Dr. Sun with disbelief. I saw Dr. Sun put down the phone with a grave look on his face, turned to me and said, “Your Flag is down again!\nAfter looking at Dr. Sun carefully, I said with a disdainful face, “Humph! You just know how to tease me! Just now when you finally said there was a scene, there was no sound in the phone. And! Look at your eyebrows are flying up to the sky, if you want to laugh, laugh out, don’t hold in a face of folds!\n“Ah ha ha ha, I can’t hide it from you! Dr. Sun laughed out happily.\n“No sooner had Dr. Sun’s words left his mouth than his cell phone rang again. He raised his hand and found that it was the director calling again.\n“Ah, what’s wrong with the director?” Forensic scientist Sun picked up the phone, “Huh? Oh! Okay, let’s read the notice sheet first, then we’ll leave right away, see you at the scene!\nThe forensic scientist hung up the phone and turned his head to look at me, and a face worse than tears appeared before my eyes: “This time there is a real scene.\nThis was like a bolt from the blue! Because the daily shift is 8:30 am, now even 8:00 am has not yet arrived, the case at this time is still considered me and Dr. Sun forensic.\nUnhappy is unhappy, but the work must be done. Besides, “young people, it is necessary to work more to gain more knowledge! I sometimes admire my ability to comfort myself.\nAfter driving an hour to the scene with Dr. Sun, I parked the car and went to the trunk to take out a survey box. The last scene on my body survey undershirt “strategic reserve” is almost depleted, can only carry this dead weight of the box.\nThe scene in a small highway next to the green belt, the small road looks like just recently repaired, the roadside saplings are just planted in. The scene has been pulled a good cordon, but in order not to affect the highway traffic, pull the scope of a little small, plus some onlookers blocked in front of the eyes, simply can not see what kind of inside.\nI looked down through the barrier, the first thing I saw was a white SUV car with a male body lying on the side. The director and forensic scientist Sun were pointing at the body and the car and saying something, so I lifted my foot and walked towards them.\n“Hey! Watch your step!!!” Just as I reached the sapling, I heard someone yell out to me.\nI looked down and realized that I had just been so focused on the corpse that I hadn’t even noticed the puddle of headlight debris in the direction I was going.\nI smiled shyly at my colleague who had warned me and walked around the debris.\nThere were two obvious rut marks in the grass by the roadside saplings, the grass in the rut marks had fallen over, and a physical evidence plate was placed next to a small tree, which marked out a small puddle of blood. Along the rut marks forward is a small piece of sand, the car and the body are placed on this small piece of sand, the ground footprints, tire tread marks are particularly messy. The front end of the car rushed to a bush that had been skewed, and the bush appeared again next to the rutted tracks, this time extending all the way to the fence.\nWhat struck me as odd was that the director and Dr. Sun were not looking at the body, but rather at the wheels of the SUV - more specifically, a fender above the left rear wheel.\n“You see a bloodstain here, obviously in a directional wipe shape.” The director said to Dr. Sun while gesturing in the direction, “And this direction is from the back to the front.\n“Director, the study of bloodstains, more should be the trace investigation they do, right? I asked the director in confusion, “How did you start studying this?\n“The director said, “We’ve learned a lot about this over the years, so let’s use it when we have the chance. The director said to me.\nThe director said to me, “There is no rule that forensic pathologists can’t do this. And, this case is all about these details. Because there are two people who say they drove the car and killed someone.\n“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a person compete to be a suspect.” I put down the case and started to prepare their equipment and tools.\n“The two suspects, plus the victim, are a family of three, a father and two sons, the younger son died, and now his father and his elder brother both say they were driving.\nThe director introduced the situation to me and Dr. Sun forensics.\n“This family got a lot of compensation because of the demolition, the car is when the father bought a new, money and house or something also have a lot. The brothers had a lot of conflicts because of this property distribution, the father not only did not stop, but also joined in the quarrel together. Last night, the three of them argued all night long. At 4:00 am, the youngest son took advantage of the other two’s inattention and ran out with the property certificate. After that, the two men’s stories differed.\n“The older son said he found out his brother ran away first and came out to chase him in his car, and after he caught up with him, he told his brother not to leave first and to get in the car for discussion. I didn’t expect my brother to listen, so he became angry and tried to speed up to stop him. I did not expect to hit my brother, after knocking him down a thrill, directly into the bushes, backing out of the car felt the rear wheels pressed into something, after parking found his brother crushed under the wheels, and rushed to get into the car moved down. After more than an hour, Dad came after him and saw that it had been so.\n“The father said that he found it first, drove out to catch up, after catching up, drove after him, followed all the way to the noise, and then the father wanted to drive the youngest son don’t live, didn’t expect to control the speed of the youngest son rushed into the past, this impulse does not matter, a thrill to the gas pedal as a brake, the whole car went straight through the bushes, hit the fence before stopping. The father wanted to back the car out of the bushes to get out of the car, ah, did not expect to feel the rear wheel pressed into something when backing up, rushed to stop down to see, and found that his youngest son was pressed under the wheel, then fainted. The older son told him he ran for more than an hour before catching up with them, and when he saw the scene, he moved the car away, but the younger son was already dead.\n“These two people actually said quite similar things, but both said they were the ones driving at the time.” The director finally summed it up\n“The director concluded, “Only one of these two people must be telling the truth, we can’t just listen to this, let’s see the body.\n“Hey? We can check the fingerprints on the steering wheel or DNA to know who was driving the car, right? I can’t help but want to praise myself for my own resourcefulness.\n“No way! You think about it, the car is often driven by the father, so no matter who the two people say prevails, the car can appear two people’s information. The car was originally their own home, so it is quite normal for the three of them to have fingerprints or DNA on the car, which is impossible to judge.\n“So is there any video surveillance?” I saw that I seemed to have asked a stupid question, and hurriedly thought of another witty one.\n“I think it’s a good idea! The doctor gave me a white look, “this article is already remote, and just repaired, there is no time to install. And it was more than 4:00 a.m., there was no one on the road. So, the case has neither video footage nor witnesses. It seems that hope is on the body.\nHearing this from Dr. Sun, I felt a little bit of excitement, it was finally the forensic pathologist’s turn to find out the truth!\nAfter investigating the scene, we took the body back to the autopsy room, and Dr. Sun and I did the autopsy while the director was guiding and recording.\n“I think this case is different from the past, the key is on the surface of the body, not inside. The director said to me and Sun in a more affirmative tone, “Do the body surface more carefully and more detailed.\nI and Sun forensic medicine to take orders, and began to work.\nThe body surface examination found: the deceased’s head and face was bruised, bilateral lid conjunctiva congestion, there are a lot of bleeding spots; the left frontal area has a\nPictures\n“It seems to be a little more wounded. After the post-mortem, I did not think, “two people mentioned the car hit people, car crushed people, a little more injury is not normal?\n“You still need to learn more! You look here, here and there first.” The director listened to my doubts and pointed to the contusions on the corpse’s left calf, left hip and left shoulder and said to me, “And the contusion trauma on the head, do these injuries remind you of anything?\n“Collision triad!” I instantly thought of a knowledge that I remembered from school.\nThe front bumper of the vehicle hits the leg first, because the leg is under the center of gravity, plus the forward speed of the vehicle, the body tumbles, the upper body tilts toward the body, the lower body goes up, the whole person presents a knocked up appearance. After that, the body falls to the hood can form a second impact injury. Because the vehicle has forward speed, and the human body has the inertia of backward motion, it will lead to the human body on the hood to slide backward relative to the car, resulting in the head and shoulders hit the front windshield to form the third injury.\n“The person was walking on the side of the road and the car hit from the left side, so these injuries on the left side of the person’s leg, hip, shoulder and head should be the collision triad. I was a little excited, “I learned the theory back then, but I finally saw a live case today!\n“That’s good, that’s a collision triad. The director was happy, “This means that the two people’s description of the car having an acceleration and then hitting the person should still be credible.\n“But that still doesn’t distinguish who’s telling the truth, does it? Although I answered the question about the triple injury, I didn’t see the effect on distinguishing the truth from the falsity of the two people.\nThe director pointed to the contusion band on the chest and said, “The key is right here. Take a closer look and see what the characteristics of these contusions are.\n“Hmm? There seems to be a bit of a pattern, with little burr-like flaps of skin around the edge of each contusion.” I looked down at the contusion with the tire tread.\n“Well, that’s good.” The director acknowledged my observation, “Continue to see what other features?”\n“It seems …… like they’re all in one direction.” I studied it a little more closely, “Ah! I remember! I remember that this feature can indicate the direction of the force that caused the contusion. In a similar abrasion or contusion in which the epidermis is peeling, the flap is in the direction of the external force acting on it.”\n“Very good, very good, so, your conclusion is?” The director asked me, still in doubt.\n“The direction of the source of this …… uh …… force from the left shoulder to the right axilla is from the shoulder toward the axilla. And the direction from the left shoulder to the right upper arm is from the right arm towards the left shoulder.” I thought about it and replied, “Eh? No, these two directions are opposite! One is diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, and the other is right to left.”\n“That’s the point I was making. The director seemed to have it all figured out, “Take a good look and think about it.\n“I see.” I understand,” Dr. Sun answered the director’s question ahead of me, “according to the life response, the two different directions of injury are formed before birth. There is no significant difference other than the direction.\n“Well ……” I followed Dr. Sun’s words, recalled the case described by the director when I was at the scene, and said to myself.\n“The eldest son said he hit his brother, then backed up and crushed him afterwards, then immediately moved the car again. The father said he hit his younger son with his car, then backed up and crushed him, and passed out.\n“So the dad was lying! I think a light bulb must have gone off in my head at that time, “These two contusion bands were formed when the first reversing car crushed the person and the second moving the car, but because they were both shown as pre-mortem injuries, it means that the interval between the two vehicle movements was relatively short, if, according to the father, the eldest son arrived an hour later to move the car, then the two contusion bands should be distinctly different, one showing pre-mortem injuries and the other showing post-mortem injuries! one shows as post-mortem damage!”\nAfter saying this, the atmosphere in the autopsy room felt a sense of relief, after all, a very critical issue in this case had been resolved.\n“What about the order in which the two contusion bands were formed? The director seemed to have a problem today.\n“The one that runs diagonally from the upper left to the lower right is formed first. The one from the right arm to the left shoulder is the second one. The first time I asked a few questions, Dr. Sun rushed to answer, “I remembered the wipe-like blood on the fender above the wheel.\n“The deceased had a collision with a triple injury, and he fell from the car with his head backward and his feet forward, according to what I just said. Dr. Sun brought up the content of my answer, “Although this collision triple injury caused a lot of injuries, but not necessarily cause death, this time the car backwards is equivalent to his right side to the left side of his body, the wheel force on the body and the direction of wheel rotation is reversed, that is, the direction of the force is from the left to the right. In the process, he formed that wipe-like blood mark from back to front on the left side of that car’s fender. And then after moving the car, and is driving forward, this time has been pressed to the body of the deceased, so driving forward, the direction of force is from the right to the left, in line with the performance of those flaps.\n“What about falling from the car is head forward, feet backward? I reacted to what Dr. Sun said.\n“The possibility of what you said certainly exists, but certainly not in this case. Sun forensics is very confident, “because you see this oblique line of contusion belt is just under the clavicle, think about it, if the reverse first pressed from the left shoulder to the right shoulder, although the direction of the skin flap is consistent, but the second time also along the oblique line of that drive down ah, but now the wheel here in the right arm, how can run to the left shoulder there and then out from the armpit? If you drive back the same way and then switch the direction of the diagonal, it will destroy the skin flap form. In fact, the key to say so roundabout is that the junction position of these two contusion zones is in the left shoulder. This must be the starting and ending point of the two wheel movements.”\n“Ah!” I was already slow to react, and with no sleep last night, I was a bit confused and took a while to understand after holding the dissection table.\nThe next autopsy did not reveal anything very special, but the expected injuries: a large subscalp hemorrhage in the left occipital area; fractures of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs on the left side, including two fractures of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th ribs; fractures of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs on the right side, with the 3rd and 5th ribs bent inward and depressed; and about 200 ml of blood in each of the bilateral thoracic cavities. There was blood accumulation in the chest cavity on each side, lacerations in the root of the lungs on both sides, and a ruptured heart.\nWe reported the results of the autopsy to our colleagues in charge of the inquest, and soon came the news that the father of the deceased admitted that he was lying. The reason is simple, when he arrived at the scene to find that his eldest son had done wrong, he did not want to lose one son after the other to go to jail, he used his age as a reason to persuade his eldest son to let him carry things alone, did not expect the eldest son did not follow the pre-discussed to say, and finally the forensic pathologist saw the loophole.\nAs for why the eldest son finally changed his mind and told the truth, he said it was when he found himself crushed his brother, and his father came to protect himself, at that moment he suddenly realized that the whole family for money such extraneous things even to this unmanageable situation, it is really wrong to be wrong, that moment of repentance let him decide to bear the mistakes they made.\nAfter doing the case of the brother who drove his brother to death, I recalled the night before the wife who killed her husband.\nThis death, a lot of human feelings are out.\n(End)\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>We have all seen the crime, kill people and then do their best to conceal the facts of the crime, but who has heard of the race to become a murderer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to work tomorrow, it&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s great! I&rsquo;m not going to work tomorrow, so I can be as lazy as I want! Listening to the rhythm of the music on my phone, I couldn&rsquo;t help but hum along. The interesting Sichuan lyrics make me feel close to Chengdu after living there for many years, and more importantly, this song simply sings out my heart now!</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the National Day holiday, although last night a hundred miles out of a super far site in the middle of the night, almost a sleepless night, rushed back to the autopsy to finish at 7:00 am, but think about a few shifts for colleagues before, and then this holiday will not have to be on duty, can go to a good sleep, a good rest, do not have to guard the phone to be summoned feeling, but still makes me happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;~~~~~&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cell phone of Dr. Sun, who had just finished the autopsy together, rang. He lit up the screen to me, and when I saw the word &ldquo;director&rdquo;, I hurriedly paused the music, but I was still immersed in the feeling of &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s me. We just finished the autopsy at midnight last night. Yes! The wife killed her husband and then burned the body. No problem! The head wound was fatal. A titty hammer-like tool was used. Hmm! Okay, okay! All sorts of things were mentioned, so don&rsquo;t worry Chief!&rdquo; I listened to Dr. Sun&rsquo;s answer and knew it was the director who was asking about last night&rsquo;s case. The autopsy was not difficult, and the case would be solved when the source of the body was found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah? What? Another scene? Yeah! I know, we&rsquo;re on our way!&rdquo; Dr. Sun&rsquo;s next answer was a cold shower on my head! I looked at Dr. Sun with disbelief.</p>
<p>I looked at Dr. Sun with disbelief. I saw Dr. Sun put down the phone with a grave look on his face, turned to me and said, &ldquo;Your Flag is down again!</p>
<p>After looking at Dr. Sun carefully, I said with a disdainful face, &ldquo;Humph! You just know how to tease me! Just now when you finally said there was a scene, there was no sound in the phone. And! Look at your eyebrows are flying up to the sky, if you want to laugh, laugh out, don&rsquo;t hold in a face of folds!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha ha ha, I can&rsquo;t hide it from you! Dr. Sun laughed out happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sooner had Dr. Sun&rsquo;s words left his mouth than his cell phone rang again. He raised his hand and found that it was the director calling again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what&rsquo;s wrong with the director?&rdquo; Forensic scientist Sun picked up the phone, &ldquo;Huh? Oh! Okay, let&rsquo;s read the notice sheet first, then we&rsquo;ll leave right away, see you at the scene!</p>
<p>The forensic scientist hung up the phone and turned his head to look at me, and a face worse than tears appeared before my eyes: &ldquo;This time there is a real scene.</p>
<p>This was like a bolt from the blue! Because the daily shift is 8:30 am, now even 8:00 am has not yet arrived, the case at this time is still considered me and Dr. Sun forensic.</p>
<p>Unhappy is unhappy, but the work must be done. Besides, &ldquo;young people, it is necessary to work more to gain more knowledge! I sometimes admire my ability to comfort myself.</p>
<p>After driving an hour to the scene with Dr. Sun, I parked the car and went to the trunk to take out a survey box. The last scene on my body survey undershirt &ldquo;strategic reserve&rdquo; is almost depleted, can only carry this dead weight of the box.</p>
<p>The scene in a small highway next to the green belt, the small road looks like just recently repaired, the roadside saplings are just planted in. The scene has been pulled a good cordon, but in order not to affect the highway traffic, pull the scope of a little small, plus some onlookers blocked in front of the eyes, simply can not see what kind of inside.</p>
<p>I looked down through the barrier, the first thing I saw was a white SUV car with a male body lying on the side. The director and forensic scientist Sun were pointing at the body and the car and saying something, so I lifted my foot and walked towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Watch your step!!!&rdquo; Just as I reached the sapling, I heard someone yell out to me.</p>
<p>I looked down and realized that I had just been so focused on the corpse that I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed the puddle of headlight debris in the direction I was going.</p>
<p>I smiled shyly at my colleague who had warned me and walked around the debris.</p>
<p>There were two obvious rut marks in the grass by the roadside saplings, the grass in the rut marks had fallen over, and a physical evidence plate was placed next to a small tree, which marked out a small puddle of blood. Along the rut marks forward is a small piece of sand, the car and the body are placed on this small piece of sand, the ground footprints, tire tread marks are particularly messy. The front end of the car rushed to a bush that had been skewed, and the bush appeared again next to the rutted tracks, this time extending all the way to the fence.</p>
<p>What struck me as odd was that the director and Dr. Sun were not looking at the body, but rather at the wheels of the SUV - more specifically, a fender above the left rear wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see a bloodstain here, obviously in a directional wipe shape.&rdquo; The director said to Dr. Sun while gesturing in the direction, &ldquo;And this direction is from the back to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Director, the study of bloodstains, more should be the trace investigation they do, right? I asked the director in confusion, &ldquo;How did you start studying this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The director said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned a lot about this over the years, so let&rsquo;s use it when we have the chance. The director said to me.</p>
<p>The director said to me, &ldquo;There is no rule that forensic pathologists can&rsquo;t do this. And, this case is all about these details. Because there are two people who say they drove the car and killed someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen a person compete to be a suspect.&rdquo; I put down the case and started to prepare their equipment and tools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two suspects, plus the victim, are a family of three, a father and two sons, the younger son died, and now his father and his elder brother both say they were driving.</p>
<p>The director introduced the situation to me and Dr. Sun forensics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This family got a lot of compensation because of the demolition, the car is when the father bought a new, money and house or something also have a lot. The brothers had a lot of conflicts because of this property distribution, the father not only did not stop, but also joined in the quarrel together. Last night, the three of them argued all night long. At 4:00 am, the youngest son took advantage of the other two&rsquo;s inattention and ran out with the property certificate. After that, the two men&rsquo;s stories differed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The older son said he found out his brother ran away first and came out to chase him in his car, and after he caught up with him, he told his brother not to leave first and to get in the car for discussion. I didn&rsquo;t expect my brother to listen, so he became angry and tried to speed up to stop him. I did not expect to hit my brother, after knocking him down a thrill, directly into the bushes, backing out of the car felt the rear wheels pressed into something, after parking found his brother crushed under the wheels, and rushed to get into the car moved down. After more than an hour, Dad came after him and saw that it had been so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The father said that he found it first, drove out to catch up, after catching up, drove after him, followed all the way to the noise, and then the father wanted to drive the youngest son don&rsquo;t live, didn&rsquo;t expect to control the speed of the youngest son rushed into the past, this impulse does not matter, a thrill to the gas pedal as a brake, the whole car went straight through the bushes, hit the fence before stopping. The father wanted to back the car out of the bushes to get out of the car, ah, did not expect to feel the rear wheel pressed into something when backing up, rushed to stop down to see, and found that his youngest son was pressed under the wheel, then fainted. The older son told him he ran for more than an hour before catching up with them, and when he saw the scene, he moved the car away, but the younger son was already dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two people actually said quite similar things, but both said they were the ones driving at the time.&rdquo; The director finally summed it up</p>
<p>&ldquo;The director concluded, &ldquo;Only one of these two people must be telling the truth, we can&rsquo;t just listen to this, let&rsquo;s see the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey? We can check the fingerprints on the steering wheel or DNA to know who was driving the car, right? I can&rsquo;t help but want to praise myself for my own resourcefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way! You think about it, the car is often driven by the father, so no matter who the two people say prevails, the car can appear two people&rsquo;s information. The car was originally their own home, so it is quite normal for the three of them to have fingerprints or DNA on the car, which is impossible to judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is there any video surveillance?&rdquo; I saw that I seemed to have asked a stupid question, and hurriedly thought of another witty one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a good idea! The doctor gave me a white look, &ldquo;this article is already remote, and just repaired, there is no time to install. And it was more than 4:00 a.m., there was no one on the road. So, the case has neither video footage nor witnesses. It seems that hope is on the body.</p>
<p>Hearing this from Dr. Sun, I felt a little bit of excitement, it was finally the forensic pathologist&rsquo;s turn to find out the truth!</p>
<p>After investigating the scene, we took the body back to the autopsy room, and Dr. Sun and I did the autopsy while the director was guiding and recording.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this case is different from the past, the key is on the surface of the body, not inside. The director said to me and Sun in a more affirmative tone, &ldquo;Do the body surface more carefully and more detailed.</p>
<p>I and Sun forensic medicine to take orders, and began to work.</p>
<p>The body surface examination found: the deceased&rsquo;s head and face was bruised, bilateral lid conjunctiva congestion, there are a lot of bleeding spots; the left frontal area has a</p>
<p>Pictures</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a little more wounded. After the post-mortem, I did not think, &ldquo;two people mentioned the car hit people, car crushed people, a little more injury is not normal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still need to learn more! You look here, here and there first.&rdquo; The director listened to my doubts and pointed to the contusions on the corpse&rsquo;s left calf, left hip and left shoulder and said to me, &ldquo;And the contusion trauma on the head, do these injuries remind you of anything?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collision triad!&rdquo; I instantly thought of a knowledge that I remembered from school.</p>
<p>The front bumper of the vehicle hits the leg first, because the leg is under the center of gravity, plus the forward speed of the vehicle, the body tumbles, the upper body tilts toward the body, the lower body goes up, the whole person presents a knocked up appearance. After that, the body falls to the hood can form a second impact injury. Because the vehicle has forward speed, and the human body has the inertia of backward motion, it will lead to the human body on the hood to slide backward relative to the car, resulting in the head and shoulders hit the front windshield to form the third injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person was walking on the side of the road and the car hit from the left side, so these injuries on the left side of the person&rsquo;s leg, hip, shoulder and head should be the collision triad. I was a little excited, &ldquo;I learned the theory back then, but I finally saw a live case today!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s a collision triad. The director was happy, &ldquo;This means that the two people&rsquo;s description of the car having an acceleration and then hitting the person should still be credible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that still doesn&rsquo;t distinguish who&rsquo;s telling the truth, does it? Although I answered the question about the triple injury, I didn&rsquo;t see the effect on distinguishing the truth from the falsity of the two people.</p>
<p>The director pointed to the contusion band on the chest and said, &ldquo;The key is right here. Take a closer look and see what the characteristics of these contusions are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm? There seems to be a bit of a pattern, with little burr-like flaps of skin around the edge of each contusion.&rdquo; I looked down at the contusion with the tire tread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; The director acknowledged my observation, &ldquo;Continue to see what other features?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems &hellip;&hellip; like they&rsquo;re all in one direction.&rdquo; I studied it a little more closely, &ldquo;Ah! I remember! I remember that this feature can indicate the direction of the force that caused the contusion. In a similar abrasion or contusion in which the epidermis is peeling, the flap is in the direction of the external force acting on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, very good, so, your conclusion is?&rdquo; The director asked me, still in doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The direction of the source of this &hellip;&hellip; uh &hellip;&hellip; force from the left shoulder to the right axilla is from the shoulder toward the axilla. And the direction from the left shoulder to the right upper arm is from the right arm towards the left shoulder.&rdquo; I thought about it and replied, &ldquo;Eh? No, these two directions are opposite! One is diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, and the other is right to left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point I was making. The director seemed to have it all figured out, &ldquo;Take a good look and think about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; I understand,&rdquo; Dr. Sun answered the director&rsquo;s question ahead of me, &ldquo;according to the life response, the two different directions of injury are formed before birth. There is no significant difference other than the direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; I followed Dr. Sun&rsquo;s words, recalled the case described by the director when I was at the scene, and said to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eldest son said he hit his brother, then backed up and crushed him afterwards, then immediately moved the car again. The father said he hit his younger son with his car, then backed up and crushed him, and passed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the dad was lying! I think a light bulb must have gone off in my head at that time, &ldquo;These two contusion bands were formed when the first reversing car crushed the person and the second moving the car, but because they were both shown as pre-mortem injuries, it means that the interval between the two vehicle movements was relatively short, if, according to the father, the eldest son arrived an hour later to move the car, then the two contusion bands should be distinctly different, one showing pre-mortem injuries and the other showing post-mortem injuries! one shows as post-mortem damage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying this, the atmosphere in the autopsy room felt a sense of relief, after all, a very critical issue in this case had been resolved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the order in which the two contusion bands were formed? The director seemed to have a problem today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that runs diagonally from the upper left to the lower right is formed first. The one from the right arm to the left shoulder is the second one. The first time I asked a few questions, Dr. Sun rushed to answer, &ldquo;I remembered the wipe-like blood on the fender above the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deceased had a collision with a triple injury, and he fell from the car with his head backward and his feet forward, according to what I just said. Dr. Sun brought up the content of my answer, &ldquo;Although this collision triple injury caused a lot of injuries, but not necessarily cause death, this time the car backwards is equivalent to his right side to the left side of his body, the wheel force on the body and the direction of wheel rotation is reversed, that is, the direction of the force is from the left to the right. In the process, he formed that wipe-like blood mark from back to front on the left side of that car&rsquo;s fender. And then after moving the car, and is driving forward, this time has been pressed to the body of the deceased, so driving forward, the direction of force is from the right to the left, in line with the performance of those flaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about falling from the car is head forward, feet backward? I reacted to what Dr. Sun said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The possibility of what you said certainly exists, but certainly not in this case. Sun forensics is very confident, &ldquo;because you see this oblique line of contusion belt is just under the clavicle, think about it, if the reverse first pressed from the left shoulder to the right shoulder, although the direction of the skin flap is consistent, but the second time also along the oblique line of that drive down ah, but now the wheel here in the right arm, how can run to the left shoulder there and then out from the armpit? If you drive back the same way and then switch the direction of the diagonal, it will destroy the skin flap form. In fact, the key to say so roundabout is that the junction position of these two contusion zones is in the left shoulder. This must be the starting and ending point of the two wheel movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I was already slow to react, and with no sleep last night, I was a bit confused and took a while to understand after holding the dissection table.</p>
<p>The next autopsy did not reveal anything very special, but the expected injuries: a large subscalp hemorrhage in the left occipital area; fractures of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs on the left side, including two fractures of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th ribs; fractures of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs on the right side, with the 3rd and 5th ribs bent inward and depressed; and about 200 ml of blood in each of the bilateral thoracic cavities. There was blood accumulation in the chest cavity on each side, lacerations in the root of the lungs on both sides, and a ruptured heart.</p>
<p>We reported the results of the autopsy to our colleagues in charge of the inquest, and soon came the news that the father of the deceased admitted that he was lying. The reason is simple, when he arrived at the scene to find that his eldest son had done wrong, he did not want to lose one son after the other to go to jail, he used his age as a reason to persuade his eldest son to let him carry things alone, did not expect the eldest son did not follow the pre-discussed to say, and finally the forensic pathologist saw the loophole.</p>
<p>As for why the eldest son finally changed his mind and told the truth, he said it was when he found himself crushed his brother, and his father came to protect himself, at that moment he suddenly realized that the whole family for money such extraneous things even to this unmanageable situation, it is really wrong to be wrong, that moment of repentance let him decide to bear the mistakes they made.</p>
<p>After doing the case of the brother who drove his brother to death, I recalled the night before the wife who killed her husband.</p>
<p>This death, a lot of human feelings are out.</p>
<p>(End)</p>
