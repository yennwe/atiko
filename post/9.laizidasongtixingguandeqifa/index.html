  "articleBody": "After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging? This is not all wrapped around the neck with a rope to let people die?\nIndeed, this kind of rope-like objects wrapped around the neck, through the application of external force, so that the rope-like objects compress the neck death is called strangulation, and hanged very similar. The difference is that the vast majority of strangulation is seen in cases of homicide, used to commit suicide is relatively rare. It is because of the two types of death, one tends to suicide, one tends to homicide, so how to distinguish between the two types of death is also very important for the forensic pathologist.\nAlthough these two ways look similar, but it is because the actual operation is different, it is bound to leave a different performance on the body, these performances may not feel much difference to the layman, but the forensic professional point of view is that there are some worlds apart, especially in the neck this key part, the formation of the two ways alone is not the same injury. In short, the forensic pathologist can distinguish between these two very similar deaths by understanding the case, site investigation, and finally combined with the most important autopsy. It is not so easy to fool the eyes of the forensic pathologist.\nMore than 700 years ago, in the Song Dynasty, the originator of forensic medicine, Song Tzu, dedicated a separate chapter to self-hanging, showing the long history of this form of death and the importance attached to it.\n“If you hang yourself under a house, first look at the place where you hanged yourself, and see that there is a lot of dust and dirt on the beams and trusses. If there is no dust at all, it is not self-hanging. First, use the staff to knock gently on the rope tied, if it is tight and straight, it is. If the corpse is moved, it will be moved slowly. If the corpse is moved and hung elsewhere, there will be two marks when the old marks are moved. (From the 1958 Law Publishing House, based on the edition of Sun Xingyan in the twelfth year of the Qing dynasty, “The Collection of Injustice”, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)\nTranslated into vernacular, it means\nIf one hangs oneself under a beam, one should first examine the beam, lintel, purlin, etc.: if dust rolls down from it in many places, then it is a real self-hanging; if there is only one place where there is no dust, then it is not a self-hanging. If the rope is tight, it is really self-hanging; if the rope is loose, it is the one that moves the corpse. Generally speaking, if the body is moved to another place for hanging, the marks on the neck will change and two constriction marks will appear.\nThis paragraph provides a way to identify the self-hanged or hanged after death, mainly based on the focus of the investigation at the scene to check the location of the hanging dust and rope tightness, or a certain amount of truth. However, these two can only be used as a reference and provide a basis for suspicion, and not as an absolute basis for the final judgment. The performance of the corpse on top of the latter is very useful. Similar to this, where the forensic conclusion must be based on reality, not just rely on theory to explain the problem.\nAs Lord Song said hundreds of years ago: “It is advisable to be careful!\nNot only in forensic medicine, but also in the whole system of medicine, there is this common feature.\nThere are no absolutes in medicine.\nAlthough we often say that the human body is a sophisticated machine, but this is only a metaphor, it is absolutely not according to the standardization of the machine to look at the human body, a lot of medical problems are definitely not black and white, one person can appear to be a manifestation does not necessarily mean that others will also be the same. Therefore, for forensic medicine, when making various judgments should be combined with all aspects of information, comprehensive consideration, not rigid thinking.\nFinally, the thoughtful Lord Song also gave a small example.\n“There are many people who are women, manpower, or outsiders hang themselves at home, they do not know the law, to avoid seeing the stench and avoid testing, so move the body out of hanging, the old marks move, resulting in two marks. The old marks are purple and red with blood shade, while the mobile marks are only white without blood shade. (From the 1958 Legal Publishing House, based on the Qing dynasty’s twelfth year, Sun Xingyan Yuanjian, a proof-text edition of “The Collection of Wrongdoing”, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)\nTranslated into vernacular, it means\nIn ancient times, it was common for maids and servants to hang themselves at home, but since the master of the house did not know the law, he would secretly move the body outside and hang it up again to avoid the stench of the body and the trouble caused by the official inspection. After this move, the original one rope marks will become two. The original constriction mark of the self-hanging is purple-red with bleeding, and the later moving constriction mark is white without bleeding.\nThis method of judging whether the constriction marks were formed before birth or after death based on the color and the presence of bleeding is very scientific, and in modern forensic medicine, the presence of bleeding at the injury is still one of the important bases for judging whether the injury is “before birth or after death”. 700 years ago, the ancients already noticed this point, which makes people today marvel.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>After reading the above heavy case, the reader may have such questions: this time there is video as evidence, that if one is strangled by others, and then hang up disguised as a self-hanging? This is not all wrapped around the neck with a rope to let people die?</p>
<p>Indeed, this kind of rope-like objects wrapped around the neck, through the application of external force, so that the rope-like objects compress the neck death is called strangulation, and hanged very similar. The difference is that the vast majority of strangulation is seen in cases of homicide, used to commit suicide is relatively rare. It is because of the two types of death, one tends to suicide, one tends to homicide, so how to distinguish between the two types of death is also very important for the forensic pathologist.</p>
<p>Although these two ways look similar, but it is because the actual operation is different, it is bound to leave a different performance on the body, these performances may not feel much difference to the layman, but the forensic professional point of view is that there are some worlds apart, especially in the neck this key part, the formation of the two ways alone is not the same injury. In short, the forensic pathologist can distinguish between these two very similar deaths by understanding the case, site investigation, and finally combined with the most important autopsy. It is not so easy to fool the eyes of the forensic pathologist.</p>
<p>More than 700 years ago, in the Song Dynasty, the originator of forensic medicine, Song Tzu, dedicated a separate chapter to self-hanging, showing the long history of this form of death and the importance attached to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hang yourself under a house, first look at the place where you hanged yourself, and see that there is a lot of dust and dirt on the beams and trusses. If there is no dust at all, it is not self-hanging. First, use the staff to knock gently on the rope tied, if it is tight and straight, it is. If the corpse is moved, it will be moved slowly. If the corpse is moved and hung elsewhere, there will be two marks when the old marks are moved. (From the 1958 Law Publishing House, based on the edition of Sun Xingyan in the twelfth year of the Qing dynasty, &ldquo;The Collection of Injustice&rdquo;, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)</p>
<p>Translated into vernacular, it means</p>
<p>If one hangs oneself under a beam, one should first examine the beam, lintel, purlin, etc.: if dust rolls down from it in many places, then it is a real self-hanging; if there is only one place where there is no dust, then it is not a self-hanging. If the rope is tight, it is really self-hanging; if the rope is loose, it is the one that moves the corpse. Generally speaking, if the body is moved to another place for hanging, the marks on the neck will change and two constriction marks will appear.</p>
<p>This paragraph provides a way to identify the self-hanged or hanged after death, mainly based on the focus of the investigation at the scene to check the location of the hanging dust and rope tightness, or a certain amount of truth. However, these two can only be used as a reference and provide a basis for suspicion, and not as an absolute basis for the final judgment. The performance of the corpse on top of the latter is very useful. Similar to this, where the forensic conclusion must be based on reality, not just rely on theory to explain the problem.</p>
<p>As Lord Song said hundreds of years ago: &ldquo;It is advisable to be careful!</p>
<p>Not only in forensic medicine, but also in the whole system of medicine, there is this common feature.</p>
<p>There are no absolutes in medicine.</p>
<p>Although we often say that the human body is a sophisticated machine, but this is only a metaphor, it is absolutely not according to the standardization of the machine to look at the human body, a lot of medical problems are definitely not black and white, one person can appear to be a manifestation does not necessarily mean that others will also be the same. Therefore, for forensic medicine, when making various judgments should be combined with all aspects of information, comprehensive consideration, not rigid thinking.</p>
<p>Finally, the thoughtful Lord Song also gave a small example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many people who are women, manpower, or outsiders hang themselves at home, they do not know the law, to avoid seeing the stench and avoid testing, so move the body out of hanging, the old marks move, resulting in two marks. The old marks are purple and red with blood shade, while the mobile marks are only white without blood shade. (From the 1958 Legal Publishing House, based on the Qing dynasty&rsquo;s twelfth year, Sun Xingyan Yuanjian, a proof-text edition of &ldquo;The Collection of Wrongdoing&rdquo;, Volume 3, XIX: Self-hanging)</p>
<p>Translated into vernacular, it means</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was common for maids and servants to hang themselves at home, but since the master of the house did not know the law, he would secretly move the body outside and hang it up again to avoid the stench of the body and the trouble caused by the official inspection. After this move, the original one rope marks will become two. The original constriction mark of the self-hanging is purple-red with bleeding, and the later moving constriction mark is white without bleeding.</p>
<p>This method of judging whether the constriction marks were formed before birth or after death based on the color and the presence of bleeding is very scientific, and in modern forensic medicine, the presence of bleeding at the injury is still one of the important bases for judging whether the injury is &ldquo;before birth or after death&rdquo;. 700 years ago, the ancients already noticed this point, which makes people today marvel.</p>
