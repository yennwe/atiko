  "articleBody": "In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed. Originally this furniture city because of the remote location, closing time early every day, business has been difficult to do, today there is actually a corpse inexplicably appeared. Now it was completely out of business.\n“It’s really bad luck,” Mr. Jin whined to us while leading us to the entrance of his store, pointing to the ceiling and saying to us, “Look, I was the last one to leave at 6 pm last night, and everything was fine when it closed, and now it’s like this. Hey …… tell us what this is all about!\nAn hour ago, I was lying in my chair after breakfast, and the warm but not sunny autumn sun was coming in through the window. “I wanted to sleep like this, no phone calls, no scenes, no corpses, nothing! After a big stretch, I adjusted my posture, thinking to enjoy the beautiful sunshine first, and then work later.\n“~~~~~”\n“No way! My spell of “Flag” is working again! I wailed, grabbed the phone, and the voice of the forensic scientist on duty today came over the phone: “On site! See you in the garage.”\nNo way, death does not care if the weather is good today. In fact, this feeling of the unknown is one of the main reasons why I like forensics, I don’t always know what kind of scene or body is waiting for me.\nB city is really big, after driving for more than an hour, we crossed the whole city to reach a furniture market in the suburbs, met with Mr. Jin, and the conversation at the beginning happened.\nDr. Sun and I looked up in the direction of Mr. Jin’s finger and first saw two rickety fluorescent lights. The fluorescent lights were supposed to be hung by two chains, but now only the chain on one side was still hanging strong. Looking upward along this chain, the color steel tile I-beam on the ceiling was dented, and the dented position happened to have an I-beam passing by.\n“I came to open the door at 7:00 this morning, there was a puddle of soil on the ground at that time, I did not see it at first, so I swept the puddle away, what’s the impact? Boss Jin asked us a little shortness.\nDr. Sun took a look at Mr. Jin, waved his hand and said: “This is not a big problem, we want to go to the top to see how we can go up? Is there a staircase?”\nMr. Jin smiled bitterly: “This furniture city is built with color steel tiles and steel beams, just one floor, more than 7 meters high, at the beginning did not think to go up often, there is no special channel, only a small window can climb up. But I found this situation in the morning after also want to go up to see what is going on, from that window to drill up, up to see a black mass of things, get closer to see a hand. This scares me, I climbed down and called the police, almost did not fall down at the window! Jin boss took us to this temporary small channel, a ladder to a prominent platform, a small window on the platform, there is no protection measures, it does not look too reliable dangerous look.\nDr. Sun looked at the “temporary” channel, decided to call the fire department to ask for support. Ten minutes later, a ladder truck from the fire department came to the scene. After putting on the safety protection equipment, Sun and I were sent to the roof of the furniture city on the small platform of the ladder truck.\nThe roof of the furniture city is not a platform, but both sides with a little slope, far from the past, in the ridge a little bit off the location of the color steel tile has a pit, the pit has a black mass of things. I and Sun forensics carefully along the ridge of the steel beam to the front, you can see that it is indeed a male corpse, lying on his back, but the body is black, the head is also covered by the clothes can not see the face, but also a little seemingly odor.\nSun forensics and other photographers finished taking pictures, and I carefully approached to check. I reached over and pulled the clothes down a little, and what caught my eye was a mix of black, brown, coffee-colored face, and the stench was a little more intense.\n“Well, I know it’s a person, and people are dead on the line. This is not safe up here, let’s go down and look at the details, first come help me put the body in the bag. Sun forensics said to me while laying out the body bag.\nLoad the body, we followed together with the ladder truck back to the ground, feet on the ground feels really good. The body bag was opened by Dr. Sun and I in a small open space surrounded by several cars, and the stench was even stronger than before.\n“It was bad luck that it was a corpse that had decayed. Although I muttered in my heart, my hands did not stop, quickly laying out the body bag on the ground for photography and inspection.\nSun forensic doctor looked over the body, I probe over while looking at the record: “gloves, footwear” have been formed, the fingers of one hand or dry state; body skin color because of corruption and black, some places there are small pieces of yellow, most places can not see the original skin color in the end what is. The top is in a state of upward cover the head, near the head to see some plastic bags, plastic bags in the middle to reveal a little hair, is a short thin black curly hair, a little like the black race is very common in the kind of small curly hair.\n“This looks like a black man?” I saw the hair after asking Dr. Sun forensics. The forensic scientist Sun did not deny, turned down the top to reveal the head, forehead position there is a plastic bag made of rings, loosely wrapped around the head. Sun forensics to the body left and right turned over, this turn, the plastic ring above the skull as a whole deformed.\n“The fracture of the skull is quite serious, it has broken into many pieces, I do not know if there are other fractures in the body, it seems to go back to take an X-ray and then take a closer look. Dr. Sun used his hands to stabilize the skull and carefully examined both sides, and found something stuffed in both ears, and took out small plastic fragments. I was thinking about what the significance of these things, I heard Dr. Sun say to me: “Come on, you deduce the time of death.\nMy heart was very apprehensive. Time of death inference is quite an important part of forensic work, inferring the time of death to determine the time of the crime, identify and exclude the suspect has no time to commit the crime, delineate the scope of investigation and even the final detection of the case are important, this work is quite dependent on experience and technology, need to rely on all aspects of information to make a comprehensive judgment, basically at the scene according to a variety of early body performance to determine the best Can be accurate in the range of a few hours, such as the location of the stiffness, intensity, such as the location of the corpse spot, finger pressure whether fading, such as the degree of corneal clouding, and so on - the actual work for the short time of death can be used to measure the temperature of the body to determine, this is still more accurate. However, like this time this has been corrupted, especially or has been highly corrupted, a variety of early cadaveric phenomena have long disappeared, if based on the changes in corruption to infer, the accuracy of this time may only reach the range of a few days. The time of death of highly corrupt bodies can be said to have been a nightmare for forensic pathologists.\n“This …… this …… uh …… skin discoloration is very serious, the gloves, footwear should be the formation of epidermal peeling due to corruption, these days has been 20 degrees of temperature, so look The words, almost …… a week?” I replied with great apprehension.\n“I feel like it’s been at least a week, so you’re being conservative. But how come there are no maggots? I don’t see any maggots at this level of decay, but the flies have just come to lay their eggs. Dr. Sun pointed to a yellow-white fly eggs on the body’s clothes and said to me: “It seems that this should not be the first scene of his death. Let’s pull the body back and examine it in detail, maybe there is useful information hidden in his body.\nWhen we got back to the autopsy room, we took a full-body x-ray of the body. In addition to the expected finding of “crushed skull fracture,” we also found “four fractured ribs, two fractures and deformations in the spine, and multiple fractures and deformations in the pelvis. In addition to this, age-related information was unexpectedly found: the epiphysis of the corpse was not yet closed, and it was still clear! This means that he was less than 20 years old at the time of death.\nThe next step was the post-mortem examination. First was the clothing. When the forensic pathologist is confronted with a nameless body of unknown origin, an important task is to look for information on the body and at the scene that can determine the identity of the body, this body has nothing at the scene, now we have to see if there is anything on the body to prove who he is and where he came from.\nThe deceased’s upper body is two long-sleeved pullover threads, in a state of semi-dress, the left arm has come out of the sleeve, the right side is still normal wear; lower body two pants, the outside jeans are covered with black oil and dust, the button has disappeared, the trouser pocket nothing, inside is a gray fall pants and red underwear; feet are barefoot state, not wearing shoes, and no socks. Forensic scientist Sun and I took off the clothes on the body one by one, laying them flat on the ground, examining them and taking pictures. Sun forensics said to me: “Look at these clothes are Made in where, or for us to guess where this is from people to provide some reference.\nHowever, the results were devastating. The corpse was wearing a total of five pieces of clothing, two tops from Macau, China and Bangladesh, two pants from Mongolia and El Salvador, and the innermost pair of red underwear had no trademark information, but the front of the underwear had an upside-down “Fu” and a dragon printed on the underwear, so it was estimated that the underwear was from China. Originally, I thought I could roughly guess the possible countries from the clothes I was wearing, but this time I was completely confused: there were five pieces of clothing, but they came from five places! It seems that we can only go to DNA to determine.\nAfter checking the clothes and returning to the autopsy table, I noticed a small piece of orange “cloth” pressed under the body’s shoulder. Dr. Sun told me to give this piece of cloth to others to check the source, handed me a hose to rinse the body, so as to see whether there are any injuries on the surface.\nThe upper body is nothing unusual, but when rinsing to the lower body, in the left thigh inside found a large area of broken skin, the broken area has no epidermis, the muscles on the thigh are exposed, in the edge of the broken skin can be seen with the whole thigh at a fixed angle of the slope. Seeing this damage, Dr. Sun went back to pick up the pants and began to check the corresponding location, and found that the corresponding location on the pants but not broken.\n“I took a scalpel and cut a small opening perpendicular to the edge of the broken skin, “there is no bleeding under the skin, so to speak, there is no reaction to life, this injury should be formed after death. But the pants are not even broken ah, where did the injury come from?” I was already going crazy with this inexplicable corpse: first the inexplicable appeared in the inexplicable place, then his inexplicable identity, inexplicable clothes, inexplicable wounds …… everything is inexplicable!\nSun forensics looked at my anxious look, calmly said: “Do not rush well, all the performance is certainly a reasonable explanation, just now has not found the key information that can be linked together. I see this leg injury is very much like the kind of squeezed friction formed, the pants are not damaged while the skin is worn out. Be patient, let’s finish the autopsy first.”\nI pouted behind the mask and patiently continued to do the autopsy with Dr. Sun.\nThe autopsy only found that the skull was severely broken, however the fractures were still not life responsive, which means that the skull fractures were also all formed after death. The stomach was empty, other internal organs were not found anything special, and because of the serious corruption can not be seen a subtle, extracted the blood in the heart, a small piece of liver and kidneys sent to do routine toxicology, cut off a small piece of rib cartilage to do DNA identification.\nThe autopsy is even a temporary end, but did not solve any problems, but let things become more confusing. The first question is: Who is he? Where did he come from?\n“The gold boss said only that a small window can drill up, that small window living people drill in are laborious, the body was carried up should be very difficult; if two living people to the top of the fight, was killed by the fall, but the time on the night is not possible to rot to such an extent, can make the I-beam bending, people do not have so much strength. And that pit, it’s as precise as tailor-made.” I silently thought of several possibilities, “and at the scene when I looked at the surrounding environment, the surrounding than the furniture city and then higher than the high-voltage electricity transmission tower, however, the closest one is also in a hundred meters away from the furniture city.\n“Forget it, do not think, we should go back to the scene to see it, the autopsy now get the information we still have to combine with the scene to see ah. Sun forensic doctor patted my shoulder and went out to drive away.\nBack to the furniture city, the cordon has not been withdrawn, the face than noon and also ugly gold boss saw us back, rushed to meet up and said: “You guys see if you can discuss, today because of this thing has been most of the day no business, now can not this cordon first withdrawn? I’m not doing business for a day, the rent really can not afford ah! Last year, a large ice cube fell on the roof in broad daylight has made me shut down a few days of business. This year, well, directly to a corpse, this shitty place feng shui problems, after the remaining months, next year I’m sure to leave, dead or alive, not to do here.\nI and Sun forensics heard here at the same time shouted: “ice fell on the roof?\nMr. Jin was startled: “Ah? Ice? Oh yes! Last summer, a sunny day, I was talking business that afternoon, a loud bang above my head almost scared me to death, when I climbed up from that small window to see, there was a big ice cube on the roof.\nAs we spoke, there was a roar above us, and we looked up to see a huge plane flying overhead. Jin boss then said: “We were guessing that the ice should fall from the sky, is not the aircraft on the do not know, but this happens to be the route of the airport, the aircraft passed quite frequently. Sun and I looked up at the sky, and in the distance came the sound of aircraft roar, a small black dot slowly turned into a plane, and finally flew over our heads.\n“Could it be that the body came down from the plane? I can not believe it, “the plane is flying in the sky normally, certainly not open the door to throw things, besides, the body is rotten like this, really who threw down, can not be rotten overnight like this, right? Dr. Sun looked at the plane that was flying over and instructed me to take a good look at the plane again.\nIn the distance, there happens to be another plane flying over, and as it approaches, the plane is getting bigger and bigger. Suddenly, a door opened on the belly of the plane and the landing gear was released. “Ah!!! I got it!” It finally dawned on me, “This is the landing route of the plane, when the plane flies to this neighborhood to release the landing gear in preparation for landing, so the body most likely fell out of the landing gear bin and smashed into the roof of the furniture city. In this way, the bent I-beam, falling fluorescent lights and dust, just the right pit, and multiple post-mortem fractures throughout his body, these would all make sense.”\nForensic scientist Sun nodded approvingly and said to Mr. Jin, “Don’t worry, there should be nothing more over here, let me say hello to them and remove this cordon for you.\n“As for us,” Dr. Sun said to me, “let’s go to the airport to see the plane on the ground, to see whether the landing gear compartment can put a person in addition to the wheels of the plane.\nIn the airport we looked at several models of aircraft, and finally found that those small aircraft landing gear compartment are very compact, closed and closed state is almost no free space, it is difficult to fit a person in. The landing gear compartment of several large aircraft has a lot of spare space, and there are several columns in the landing gear compartment of a certain type of aircraft, so when the landing gear is released, there is no problem for people to hide behind these columns and not fall out. The airport engineer also told us that the aircraft’s general flight cruise altitude will be more than 10,000 meters, the temperature will be in the minus tens of degrees, and very low oxygen, air pressure will also become low, landing gear cabin because it is not an airtight space, the engine noise will also be very, very loud, this environment is very difficult to survive.\nThe next day, before going to check the small piece of cloth colleagues brought back a message: the piece of cloth on that incomplete word is the name of a Hungarian airline, while last night from the owner of the furniture city to the discovery of the body this morning in 13 hours, the airport has a total of more than 140 aircraft through the route landing, which really has the airline’s aircraft, has gone to track down which one in the end.\nThis, combined with all the clues, explains the whole thing.\nThe deceased entered the landing gear compartment of the plane before she died, and also made “careful” preparations, covering her head with a plastic bag, earplugs in her ears, and wearing two layers of thicker clothing in the season when the weather was not cold. Although the preparation is meticulous, the material is very simple, just use plastic bags to protect themselves, and do not have any belongings on their bodies, clothing from around the world, presumably a person who may be wandering around the airport, most likely to sneak on the plane and chose to get into the landing gear compartment. But bad luck, chose an international flight, according to the level of corruption shows that he has been dead for at least a week, so it is likely that the first time with the plane has died on takeoff, only because of those few risers stuck to not immediately fall out, until this time may be because the plane bumps to change the position, again open the landing gear compartment to fall down. Unfortunately, because the degree of corruption is very serious, has lost the conditions to identify whether the lack of oxygen or cold and died.\nWhat a great “flying corpse”!\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>In a furniture city opened a store of gold boss this day is very depressed. Originally this furniture city because of the remote location, closing time early every day, business has been difficult to do, today there is actually a corpse inexplicably appeared. Now it was completely out of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really bad luck,&rdquo; Mr. Jin whined to us while leading us to the entrance of his store, pointing to the ceiling and saying to us, &ldquo;Look, I was the last one to leave at 6 pm last night, and everything was fine when it closed, and now it&rsquo;s like this. Hey &hellip;&hellip; tell us what this is all about!</p>
<p>An hour ago, I was lying in my chair after breakfast, and the warm but not sunny autumn sun was coming in through the window. &ldquo;I wanted to sleep like this, no phone calls, no scenes, no corpses, nothing! After a big stretch, I adjusted my posture, thinking to enjoy the beautiful sunshine first, and then work later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;~~~~~&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way! My spell of &ldquo;Flag&rdquo; is working again! I wailed, grabbed the phone, and the voice of the forensic scientist on duty today came over the phone: &ldquo;On site! See you in the garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No way, death does not care if the weather is good today. In fact, this feeling of the unknown is one of the main reasons why I like forensics, I don&rsquo;t always know what kind of scene or body is waiting for me.</p>
<p>B city is really big, after driving for more than an hour, we crossed the whole city to reach a furniture market in the suburbs, met with Mr. Jin, and the conversation at the beginning happened.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun and I looked up in the direction of Mr. Jin&rsquo;s finger and first saw two rickety fluorescent lights. The fluorescent lights were supposed to be hung by two chains, but now only the chain on one side was still hanging strong. Looking upward along this chain, the color steel tile I-beam on the ceiling was dented, and the dented position happened to have an I-beam passing by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to open the door at 7:00 this morning, there was a puddle of soil on the ground at that time, I did not see it at first, so I swept the puddle away, what&rsquo;s the impact? Boss Jin asked us a little shortness.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun took a look at Mr. Jin, waved his hand and said: &ldquo;This is not a big problem, we want to go to the top to see how we can go up? Is there a staircase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jin smiled bitterly: &ldquo;This furniture city is built with color steel tiles and steel beams, just one floor, more than 7 meters high, at the beginning did not think to go up often, there is no special channel, only a small window can climb up. But I found this situation in the morning after also want to go up to see what is going on, from that window to drill up, up to see a black mass of things, get closer to see a hand. This scares me, I climbed down and called the police, almost did not fall down at the window! Jin boss took us to this temporary small channel, a ladder to a prominent platform, a small window on the platform, there is no protection measures, it does not look too reliable dangerous look.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun looked at the &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; channel, decided to call the fire department to ask for support. Ten minutes later, a ladder truck from the fire department came to the scene. After putting on the safety protection equipment, Sun and I were sent to the roof of the furniture city on the small platform of the ladder truck.</p>
<p>The roof of the furniture city is not a platform, but both sides with a little slope, far from the past, in the ridge a little bit off the location of the color steel tile has a pit, the pit has a black mass of things. I and Sun forensics carefully along the ridge of the steel beam to the front, you can see that it is indeed a male corpse, lying on his back, but the body is black, the head is also covered by the clothes can not see the face, but also a little seemingly odor.</p>
<p>Sun forensics and other photographers finished taking pictures, and I carefully approached to check. I reached over and pulled the clothes down a little, and what caught my eye was a mix of black, brown, coffee-colored face, and the stench was a little more intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know it&rsquo;s a person, and people are dead on the line. This is not safe up here, let&rsquo;s go down and look at the details, first come help me put the body in the bag. Sun forensics said to me while laying out the body bag.</p>
<p>Load the body, we followed together with the ladder truck back to the ground, feet on the ground feels really good. The body bag was opened by Dr. Sun and I in a small open space surrounded by several cars, and the stench was even stronger than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bad luck that it was a corpse that had decayed. Although I muttered in my heart, my hands did not stop, quickly laying out the body bag on the ground for photography and inspection.</p>
<p>Sun forensic doctor looked over the body, I probe over while looking at the record: &ldquo;gloves, footwear&rdquo; have been formed, the fingers of one hand or dry state; body skin color because of corruption and black, some places there are small pieces of yellow, most places can not see the original skin color in the end what is. The top is in a state of upward cover the head, near the head to see some plastic bags, plastic bags in the middle to reveal a little hair, is a short thin black curly hair, a little like the black race is very common in the kind of small curly hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like a black man?&rdquo; I saw the hair after asking Dr. Sun forensics. The forensic scientist Sun did not deny, turned down the top to reveal the head, forehead position there is a plastic bag made of rings, loosely wrapped around the head. Sun forensics to the body left and right turned over, this turn, the plastic ring above the skull as a whole deformed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fracture of the skull is quite serious, it has broken into many pieces, I do not know if there are other fractures in the body, it seems to go back to take an X-ray and then take a closer look. Dr. Sun used his hands to stabilize the skull and carefully examined both sides, and found something stuffed in both ears, and took out small plastic fragments. I was thinking about what the significance of these things, I heard Dr. Sun say to me: &ldquo;Come on, you deduce the time of death.</p>
<p>My heart was very apprehensive. Time of death inference is quite an important part of forensic work, inferring the time of death to determine the time of the crime, identify and exclude the suspect has no time to commit the crime, delineate the scope of investigation and even the final detection of the case are important, this work is quite dependent on experience and technology, need to rely on all aspects of information to make a comprehensive judgment, basically at the scene according to a variety of early body performance to determine the best Can be accurate in the range of a few hours, such as the location of the stiffness, intensity, such as the location of the corpse spot, finger pressure whether fading, such as the degree of corneal clouding, and so on - the actual work for the short time of death can be used to measure the temperature of the body to determine, this is still more accurate. However, like this time this has been corrupted, especially or has been highly corrupted, a variety of early cadaveric phenomena have long disappeared, if based on the changes in corruption to infer, the accuracy of this time may only reach the range of a few days. The time of death of highly corrupt bodies can be said to have been a nightmare for forensic pathologists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &hellip;&hellip; this &hellip;&hellip; uh &hellip;&hellip; skin discoloration is very serious, the gloves, footwear should be the formation of epidermal peeling due to corruption, these days has been 20 degrees of temperature, so look The words, almost &hellip;&hellip; a week?&rdquo; I replied with great apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s been at least a week, so you&rsquo;re being conservative. But how come there are no maggots? I don&rsquo;t see any maggots at this level of decay, but the flies have just come to lay their eggs. Dr. Sun pointed to a yellow-white fly eggs on the body&rsquo;s clothes and said to me: &ldquo;It seems that this should not be the first scene of his death. Let&rsquo;s pull the body back and examine it in detail, maybe there is useful information hidden in his body.</p>
<p>When we got back to the autopsy room, we took a full-body x-ray of the body. In addition to the expected finding of &ldquo;crushed skull fracture,&rdquo; we also found &ldquo;four fractured ribs, two fractures and deformations in the spine, and multiple fractures and deformations in the pelvis. In addition to this, age-related information was unexpectedly found: the epiphysis of the corpse was not yet closed, and it was still clear! This means that he was less than 20 years old at the time of death.</p>
<p>The next step was the post-mortem examination. First was the clothing. When the forensic pathologist is confronted with a nameless body of unknown origin, an important task is to look for information on the body and at the scene that can determine the identity of the body, this body has nothing at the scene, now we have to see if there is anything on the body to prove who he is and where he came from.</p>
<p>The deceased&rsquo;s upper body is two long-sleeved pullover threads, in a state of semi-dress, the left arm has come out of the sleeve, the right side is still normal wear; lower body two pants, the outside jeans are covered with black oil and dust, the button has disappeared, the trouser pocket nothing, inside is a gray fall pants and red underwear; feet are barefoot state, not wearing shoes, and no socks. Forensic scientist Sun and I took off the clothes on the body one by one, laying them flat on the ground, examining them and taking pictures. Sun forensics said to me: &ldquo;Look at these clothes are Made in where, or for us to guess where this is from people to provide some reference.</p>
<p>However, the results were devastating. The corpse was wearing a total of five pieces of clothing, two tops from Macau, China and Bangladesh, two pants from Mongolia and El Salvador, and the innermost pair of red underwear had no trademark information, but the front of the underwear had an upside-down &ldquo;Fu&rdquo; and a dragon printed on the underwear, so it was estimated that the underwear was from China. Originally, I thought I could roughly guess the possible countries from the clothes I was wearing, but this time I was completely confused: there were five pieces of clothing, but they came from five places! It seems that we can only go to DNA to determine.</p>
<p>After checking the clothes and returning to the autopsy table, I noticed a small piece of orange &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; pressed under the body&rsquo;s shoulder. Dr. Sun told me to give this piece of cloth to others to check the source, handed me a hose to rinse the body, so as to see whether there are any injuries on the surface.</p>
<p>The upper body is nothing unusual, but when rinsing to the lower body, in the left thigh inside found a large area of broken skin, the broken area has no epidermis, the muscles on the thigh are exposed, in the edge of the broken skin can be seen with the whole thigh at a fixed angle of the slope. Seeing this damage, Dr. Sun went back to pick up the pants and began to check the corresponding location, and found that the corresponding location on the pants but not broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took a scalpel and cut a small opening perpendicular to the edge of the broken skin, &ldquo;there is no bleeding under the skin, so to speak, there is no reaction to life, this injury should be formed after death. But the pants are not even broken ah, where did the injury come from?&rdquo; I was already going crazy with this inexplicable corpse: first the inexplicable appeared in the inexplicable place, then his inexplicable identity, inexplicable clothes, inexplicable wounds &hellip;&hellip; everything is inexplicable!</p>
<p>Sun forensics looked at my anxious look, calmly said: &ldquo;Do not rush well, all the performance is certainly a reasonable explanation, just now has not found the key information that can be linked together. I see this leg injury is very much like the kind of squeezed friction formed, the pants are not damaged while the skin is worn out. Be patient, let&rsquo;s finish the autopsy first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pouted behind the mask and patiently continued to do the autopsy with Dr. Sun.</p>
<p>The autopsy only found that the skull was severely broken, however the fractures were still not life responsive, which means that the skull fractures were also all formed after death. The stomach was empty, other internal organs were not found anything special, and because of the serious corruption can not be seen a subtle, extracted the blood in the heart, a small piece of liver and kidneys sent to do routine toxicology, cut off a small piece of rib cartilage to do DNA identification.</p>
<p>The autopsy is even a temporary end, but did not solve any problems, but let things become more confusing. The first question is: Who is he? Where did he come from?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold boss said only that a small window can drill up, that small window living people drill in are laborious, the body was carried up should be very difficult; if two living people to the top of the fight, was killed by the fall, but the time on the night is not possible to rot to such an extent, can make the I-beam bending, people do not have so much strength. And that pit, it&rsquo;s as precise as tailor-made.&rdquo; I silently thought of several possibilities, &ldquo;and at the scene when I looked at the surrounding environment, the surrounding than the furniture city and then higher than the high-voltage electricity transmission tower, however, the closest one is also in a hundred meters away from the furniture city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, do not think, we should go back to the scene to see it, the autopsy now get the information we still have to combine with the scene to see ah. Sun forensic doctor patted my shoulder and went out to drive away.</p>
<p>Back to the furniture city, the cordon has not been withdrawn, the face than noon and also ugly gold boss saw us back, rushed to meet up and said: &ldquo;You guys see if you can discuss, today because of this thing has been most of the day no business, now can not this cordon first withdrawn? I&rsquo;m not doing business for a day, the rent really can not afford ah! Last year, a large ice cube fell on the roof in broad daylight has made me shut down a few days of business. This year, well, directly to a corpse, this shitty place feng shui problems, after the remaining months, next year I&rsquo;m sure to leave, dead or alive, not to do here.</p>
<p>I and Sun forensics heard here at the same time shouted: &ldquo;ice fell on the roof?</p>
<p>Mr. Jin was startled: &ldquo;Ah? Ice? Oh yes! Last summer, a sunny day, I was talking business that afternoon, a loud bang above my head almost scared me to death, when I climbed up from that small window to see, there was a big ice cube on the roof.</p>
<p>As we spoke, there was a roar above us, and we looked up to see a huge plane flying overhead. Jin boss then said: &ldquo;We were guessing that the ice should fall from the sky, is not the aircraft on the do not know, but this happens to be the route of the airport, the aircraft passed quite frequently. Sun and I looked up at the sky, and in the distance came the sound of aircraft roar, a small black dot slowly turned into a plane, and finally flew over our heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be that the body came down from the plane? I can not believe it, &ldquo;the plane is flying in the sky normally, certainly not open the door to throw things, besides, the body is rotten like this, really who threw down, can not be rotten overnight like this, right? Dr. Sun looked at the plane that was flying over and instructed me to take a good look at the plane again.</p>
<p>In the distance, there happens to be another plane flying over, and as it approaches, the plane is getting bigger and bigger. Suddenly, a door opened on the belly of the plane and the landing gear was released. &ldquo;Ah!!! I got it!&rdquo; It finally dawned on me, &ldquo;This is the landing route of the plane, when the plane flies to this neighborhood to release the landing gear in preparation for landing, so the body most likely fell out of the landing gear bin and smashed into the roof of the furniture city. In this way, the bent I-beam, falling fluorescent lights and dust, just the right pit, and multiple post-mortem fractures throughout his body, these would all make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forensic scientist Sun nodded approvingly and said to Mr. Jin, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, there should be nothing more over here, let me say hello to them and remove this cordon for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for us,&rdquo; Dr. Sun said to me, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to the airport to see the plane on the ground, to see whether the landing gear compartment can put a person in addition to the wheels of the plane.</p>
<p>In the airport we looked at several models of aircraft, and finally found that those small aircraft landing gear compartment are very compact, closed and closed state is almost no free space, it is difficult to fit a person in. The landing gear compartment of several large aircraft has a lot of spare space, and there are several columns in the landing gear compartment of a certain type of aircraft, so when the landing gear is released, there is no problem for people to hide behind these columns and not fall out. The airport engineer also told us that the aircraft&rsquo;s general flight cruise altitude will be more than 10,000 meters, the temperature will be in the minus tens of degrees, and very low oxygen, air pressure will also become low, landing gear cabin because it is not an airtight space, the engine noise will also be very, very loud, this environment is very difficult to survive.</p>
<p>The next day, before going to check the small piece of cloth colleagues brought back a message: the piece of cloth on that incomplete word is the name of a Hungarian airline, while last night from the owner of the furniture city to the discovery of the body this morning in 13 hours, the airport has a total of more than 140 aircraft through the route landing, which really has the airline&rsquo;s aircraft, has gone to track down which one in the end.</p>
<p>This, combined with all the clues, explains the whole thing.</p>
<p>The deceased entered the landing gear compartment of the plane before she died, and also made &ldquo;careful&rdquo; preparations, covering her head with a plastic bag, earplugs in her ears, and wearing two layers of thicker clothing in the season when the weather was not cold. Although the preparation is meticulous, the material is very simple, just use plastic bags to protect themselves, and do not have any belongings on their bodies, clothing from around the world, presumably a person who may be wandering around the airport, most likely to sneak on the plane and chose to get into the landing gear compartment. But bad luck, chose an international flight, according to the level of corruption shows that he has been dead for at least a week, so it is likely that the first time with the plane has died on takeoff, only because of those few risers stuck to not immediately fall out, until this time may be because the plane bumps to change the position, again open the landing gear compartment to fall down. Unfortunately, because the degree of corruption is very serious, has lost the conditions to identify whether the lack of oxygen or cold and died.</p>
<p>What a great &ldquo;flying corpse&rdquo;!</p>
