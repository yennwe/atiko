If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.\nIn my last semester of college, I had to go to the Public Security Bureau for a six-month internship. At this time, I had already learned my professional knowledge and needed to combine it with practice to better understand and master the application of this theoretical knowledge.\nAt 8:00 a.m., I was eating breakfast in the cafeteria, and as soon as I sat down, forensic scientist Sun, who was on duty that day, received a call: “A body was found in the river under a bridge, according to the public. I quickly pick up the bowl of rice, put on the “scene investigation” vest, get in the police car whistled to the scene.\nThe scene is under a highway bridge. This bridge on both sides of the non-motorized road and the middle of the motorway are parallel to the three bridges, the river under the bridge is not much, the flow is not very fast, the body is prone position soaked in the river, the motorway bridge is blocked by the second pier.\n“Notify the fire department to salvage the body? Sun forensics looked at the situation under the bridge after asking a small civilian police officer on the scene.\n“They’ll be here soon! Dr. Sun, you’re on duty again today, you see every time we go to work together, it’s always bad! This must not be a case!” (Many police officers call it a “case” only if it involves a crime, but not if it can be ruled out.) The young police officer obviously knew Dr. Sun and came up to greet him, “Who is this?\n“This is the new intern student who came in a few days ago. Sun forensic doctor saw the police pointed at me, replied, “students who come to practice are looking forward to having a scene to move hands, we are the opposite, right?\n“That is of course, we work, certainly do not want to catch things when they are on duty, who wants to die? But this can not be helped, who made us do this business! The small police handed a cigarette to Sun forensics, turned to me and said, “Young people follow Sun forensics learn well, he is the best forensics here.\nAs we speak, the fire department has come, several young soldiers put on waterproof equipment, took the body bags we handed over and began to go down the river to retrieve the body.\nWatching the fire fighters tripped the river to the body next to the body in the body, Sun forensic shouted to them: “Do not rub the bottom of the river, do not touch the rocks! This is to prevent additional artificial damage on the corpse, bringing unnecessary trouble to the later autopsy.\nForensic scientist Sun led me to separate the weeds on the shore, a large circle to the river, the fire fighters have pulled the body to the shore. Sun forensics commanded the fire fighters to put the body flat on a slightly flatter riverbed, turned his head to look around as if looking for something, looked for a while to me to extend a hand. I understood the head down from the body of a vest pocket pulled out the mask, and from another pocket pulled out the gloves, rummaging and took out a ruler.\n“Hey, you are really prepared ah, is simply a mobile survey box, the survey box and heavy, commonly used on those few things but to carry, some places that is really hard ah, the future do not need to bring a box, bring you a enough. Dr. Sun watched with interest as I took out one thing after another from my body like a magic trick.\n“Let’s not make fun of me, let’s see the body first. This full of pockets of the “scene investigation” vest in the pockets of all kinds of commonly used supplies, this is still the habit of the previous apprenticeship, otherwise sometimes to some inconvenient place to work with the box is very affected.\nI also put on a pair of gloves, squatting down and began to find the zipper of the body bag. I did not expect to pull open the body bag, a huge wound on the top of the head appeared directly in front of our eyes, it looks like something hit out. Seeing this wound, Dr. Sun put away his smile just now, and his demeanor became serious.\nSun stopped me from reaching out to check the wound, and instead asked me to look through my pockets first, looking for ID cards, driver’s licenses and other things that can prove identity. I found a cell phone in the pocket of the leather jacket worn by the deceased, and found a neatly folded 1447 yuan, a set of keys and a pack of cigarettes in the pocket of the lower body jeans, nothing to directly prove the identity of the things. Sun told me to put the phone in a separate evidence bag and put the rest back in place first: “Take the body back and check it carefully, it’s likely to be a case.\nDeep and shallow to carry the body on the bridge, the investigation colleagues immediately gathered around and asked: “Well? Is it a case?\n“I’m not sure yet, but you’d better be prepared. This cell phone for you, go first to determine the source of the body. Hearing the words of forensic scientist Sun, the colleagues of the investigation have expressed their unhappiness.\nBefore leaving the scene, forensic scientist Sun again saw the small civilian police, to him a frown: “can not be? Really a case ah?” The young police officer was immediately nervous.\n“It seems you have to stay at the scene for a while longer. The police officer said, “I need an autopsy to be sure.\nBack to the autopsy room, Dr. Sun took out two sets of disposable surgical gowns and handed me a set: “The first few times I saw you do pretty well, today you’ll be the main knife, I’ll be your assistant.\nUsually corpse inspection requires at least two people to cooperate with each other to complete, generally will stand on the right hand side of the corpse called the “main knife”, because the right hand holds the knife, then, from this direction to operate from head to toe, relatively smooth, and the main knife is also the main examination and report the autopsy findings of the person.\nDress up, put on the mask, gloves, first surface inspection of the body. After taking off all the clothes, what caught the eye was one after another old scars, and a tattoo was found on the arm. I and Sun forensic medicine with the body rinsed clean, towel dry water stains, Sun forensic medicine turned to take pictures of colleagues said: “the face and the tattoo first photographed and sent to the investigation, to provide them with some clues to find people again.\n“Come on, you to determine the time of his death. Hearing the question of Sun forensic pathologist, my heart is a little bottomless, although these are learned in professional classes, but really put the theory into practice, or a little less confident.\nAccording to the textbook, the time of death in the early stages of death can be inferred from measuring the temperature of the body, but the body is soaked in water, relying on the temperature may deviate more. In addition to the temperature of the corpse, can also be inferred from some early corpse phenomena, including the formation of the site of rigor mortis, intensity, press the corpse spot can fade, check the degree of corneal clouding, and so on. When undressing just now, we found that the limbs were not much stiffness, pressed the chin of the corpse, and raised the head, and found that there was a little stiffness in the jaw and neck. The back of the corpse spot can fade with a light press. Pick up the tweezers to turn over the eyelids, the cornea is clear and transparent, no clouding at all.\nAfter doing the above, I silently thought for a moment, looked up at the clock on the wall: “I think the time of death should be less than 5 hours, it is now 10:25, that …… probably died at about 5:00 this morning. The first thing you need to do is look at Dr. Sun with a little bit of weakness.\n“Not bad, theoretically okay. Sun forensic doctor first affirmed my answer, “but I think the time can be set a little longer, more than 6 hours it. The weather is not too hot, and the body is soaking in the water, in the low temperature environment stiffness will appear a little slower. And, I don’t know if you noticed, at the scene, his face was dark red, at that time did not look closely at the injury or other, but now you see, the dark red face has faded a lot, so this should be the corpse spots, the back also appeared corpse spots.\n“I know! At the scene, the body is lying prone in the water, according to reason corpse spots should appear in front of the body, chest, face such, so then at the scene to see the face of the dark red should be corpse spots, but now the face of the corpse spots disappeared, but the back appeared corpse spots, this is the phenomenon of transfer of corpse spots. After Dr. Sun’s reminder, I remembered a phenomenon when the corpse spots first began to form.\nContinuing to check the body surface, there were some small abrasions on the face, mainly concentrated on the nose, the arch of the eyebrows, and the temporal region (located on both sides of the head, behind both eyes, and above the cheekbones, which is roughly the area near the temples). There were also some small abrasions on the back of the left hand and bilateral knees. The abrasions had a clear reaction to life, indicating that they should have been caused prenatally.\nThe body surface, apart from these minor abrasions, left the large trauma on the top of the head. I inserted a cotton swab into the wound and wiped around, and took it out and found some black sediment-like material on it.\n“This is no characteristic, the body is soaking in the river, the river’s sediment or something inevitably washed in by the water, if you find some brick chips, wood chips and so on can also explain some problems. Despite what Dr. Sun said, or let the photo colleagues to take pictures of the mud and sand above the swab fixed.\nI rinsed the wound with water and aligned the edges, and found that the entire wound was roughly in the shape of a “χ”, with the scalp and skull separated in the middle of the cross, and extending deeper to the sides, presenting a pouch-like appearance between the scalp and the skull.\n“The trauma base was uneven, the trauma margin was not smooth, and there were intertissue bridges between the trauma walls.” I reported these findings while examining, “This is typical of blunt force trauma.\n“And what is this pouch-like appearance?” Dr. Sun asked again.\nI searched my mind and thought about what I had read in books and what the teacher had said in class, but there was no mention of blunt force trauma showing such signs, so I shook my head and said I didn’t know.\n“I finally got it!” Dr. Sun laughed, “this performance is generally caused by a relatively large area of objects, previously encountered an iron plate slapped on the head, also appeared this performance. It does not matter, forensics is practice, see more naturally know.\nThe next step is to dissect, after cutting open the scalp, see the sagittal suture of the skull (located at the top of the human head, a longitudinal bone seam from front to back) and the left side of the herringbone suture (a horizontal bone seam located at the back of the head) has been cracked. After removing the skull, there was a thin layer of hematoma outside the dura on the right side, and there was hemorrhage from the subarachnoid space in both the prefrontal location of the brain and the cerebellum.\nWhen I did this, I thought to myself, “This was clearly hit with a blunt object of the type that the teacher just described, so this person was killed and then dumped in the river! I’m sure that’s it! This must be the case!”\nAfter the head, the thoracic and abdominal cavities were opened next. The surface of the lungs in the chest cavity had obvious indentation of the ribs, and there was a “twisted hair” feeling when squeezed by hand (kind of like squeezing a lock of hair and twisting it around), and red bloody fluid came out of the cut surface of the lungs. When the esophagus was opened, there was a small amount of sediment-like material adhering to the wall of the esophagus. The trachea was cut open and a large amount of white foamy fluid was found in the trachea. In the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum on the surface of the spleen was crumpled and the entire spleen was anemic in appearance. Other than that, there were no abnormal findings.\nAfter the autopsy, I was confused again: the damage seen in the head was enough to cause the person to die of cranio-cerebral injury, thinking that there would be no additional findings in the chest and abdominal cavity, but how come there were so many manifestations of drowning death by entering the water before birth?\n“Teacher, this person’s lungs showed typical signs of “watery emphysema”, and sediment and foam were found in the esophagus and trachea, as well as anemia of the spleen. These are all signs of drowning. I began to feel a little dizzy, so I had to ask the teacher for help, “The injury on this person’s head was caused by a blunt instrument, but this was followed by the manifestations of drowning. So, how exactly is the cause of death determined?”\nSun forensics did not directly answer my question, if thought for a while, decided to go back to the scene to see.\nBack to the scene, I and Sun forensic yards of highway, from one side to find the other, but did not find any useful information. Forensic scientist Sun and I were lying on the railing looking at the position of the body in the water in the morning.\n“Teacher.” I broke the silence first, “this person has a large head wound, such a large wound bleeding must be very ferocious, if it was wounded here, then the ground should leave a blood trail, right? Even if this is just a body dumping site, the transfer process should also have blood left ah. Could it be that it was floated down from upstream?”\nSun forensic doctor as if I did not hear what I was saying, lit a cigarette and still looking at the river dazed. I look at the water, and then look at Sun forensic, and did not know what he was looking at.\nA cigarette soon finished, Dr. Sun casually threw into the river, the cigarette sank in the water and floated away with the current. Suddenly, Dr. Sun “Huh”, asked me: “There is paper?\nI am more puzzled, turned out a packet of Kleenex handed to Sun forensics, he pulled out a ball into a small ball, like just threw the paper into the river, the ball of paper floated away with the current, and the direction of the floating away is - the second bridge pier!\nI stared at the ball of paper seemed to think of something, grabbed the tissue paper in the hands of Dr. Sun, also pulled out a ball into a ball and threw it down, the ball of paper once again drifted to the second pier there.\n“From the flow of the river, it really is floating down from above. I was a little frustrated, this kind of “river drift” often brings trouble to solve the case. Sometimes it’s even a problem to identify the person.\n“I don’t think so.” I think this is not a case now, but I need to get the fire department to confirm a few questions first. Forensic scientist Sun took out his cell phone and started calling the fire department in the morning, asking questions about the riverbed and the depth of the water.\nAfter hanging up the phone, Dr. Sun said to me happily, “I have an answer, they told me that the riverbed under the bridge is different from the rocky beach on the shore, the riverbed here is flat, basically no rocks, just a big concrete slab! And, there is an important information, they went down in the morning, the deepest water is just to the calf, the river is not much deeper!\nListened to the words of Sun Forensic, I immediately understood his meaning; the body head injury is not at all hit by others with blunt instruments, but from the bridge jumped to the river high fall formed. Because the river is not deep, the deceased’s head directly on the flat riverbed formed the head of that large wound, and this impact did not let him die immediately, only because of cranial damage and fainted, after the drowning occurred, and finally washed by the water to the second pier under the location of the body was found.\nLater investigators retrieved the highway surveillance video, the video shows 4:42 in the morning, a figure appeared on the bridge, in the bridge from one end to the other, back and forth several times after walking, stopped at the guardrail looking at the bridge below, about 5 minutes later over the guardrail, and then fell head first. Because of the distance, coupled with dim street lights, it is impossible to see the face, but look very much like the deceased dressed. Later contacted the family of the deceased through the cell phone card has not been damaged, the family confirmed that the person in the video is the deceased.\nFinally, the cause of death on the forensic medical opinion was written: “cranio-cerebral injury due to high fall, combined with drowning death”.\nIn this “case”, my mind was limited to the first sight of the head wound, while preconceived notions that the wound was inflicted with a blunt object because of its obvious blunt force trait. But just like the final result, blunt force injury is not necessarily a blunt object to hit the head, hitting the head with a blunt object can also be formed, so that the “sac-like” performance under the wound can also be explained through, the flat riverbed acted as a special blunt object. Moreover, because of the buffering effect of the river also makes the body does not appear in the high fall in the often occurring multiple fractures, internal organs also did not appear obvious rupture, lost a lot of high fall injury characteristics.\nThis once again reflects the forensic not only to pay attention to the body itself, but also to pay attention to the situation of the scene environment, to avoid the first conclusion and then find evidence of the way of thinking, to think outside the box to crack the problem.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Those with distinctive features and multiple eyewitnesses of the high fall is easier to determine the nature of death, defined as an accident or suicide is a relatively simple matter, after the investigation there is no obvious doubt also generally do not need to be dissected; witnesses are sufficient, the family of the deceased usually will not have any questions. If the body has the kind of plausible damage, the family will see the catch, the forensic work is also more complex.</p>
<p>In my last semester of college, I had to go to the Public Security Bureau for a six-month internship. At this time, I had already learned my professional knowledge and needed to combine it with practice to better understand and master the application of this theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m., I was eating breakfast in the cafeteria, and as soon as I sat down, forensic scientist Sun, who was on duty that day, received a call: &ldquo;A body was found in the river under a bridge, according to the public. I quickly pick up the bowl of rice, put on the &ldquo;scene investigation&rdquo; vest, get in the police car whistled to the scene.</p>
<p>The scene is under a highway bridge. This bridge on both sides of the non-motorized road and the middle of the motorway are parallel to the three bridges, the river under the bridge is not much, the flow is not very fast, the body is prone position soaked in the river, the motorway bridge is blocked by the second pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notify the fire department to salvage the body? Sun forensics looked at the situation under the bridge after asking a small civilian police officer on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here soon! Dr. Sun, you&rsquo;re on duty again today, you see every time we go to work together, it&rsquo;s always bad! This must not be a case!&rdquo; (Many police officers call it a &ldquo;case&rdquo; only if it involves a crime, but not if it can be ruled out.) The young police officer obviously knew Dr. Sun and came up to greet him, &ldquo;Who is this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the new intern student who came in a few days ago. Sun forensic doctor saw the police pointed at me, replied, &ldquo;students who come to practice are looking forward to having a scene to move hands, we are the opposite, right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is of course, we work, certainly do not want to catch things when they are on duty, who wants to die? But this can not be helped, who made us do this business! The small police handed a cigarette to Sun forensics, turned to me and said, &ldquo;Young people follow Sun forensics learn well, he is the best forensics here.</p>
<p>As we speak, the fire department has come, several young soldiers put on waterproof equipment, took the body bags we handed over and began to go down the river to retrieve the body.</p>
<p>Watching the fire fighters tripped the river to the body next to the body in the body, Sun forensic shouted to them: &ldquo;Do not rub the bottom of the river, do not touch the rocks! This is to prevent additional artificial damage on the corpse, bringing unnecessary trouble to the later autopsy.</p>
<p>Forensic scientist Sun led me to separate the weeds on the shore, a large circle to the river, the fire fighters have pulled the body to the shore. Sun forensics commanded the fire fighters to put the body flat on a slightly flatter riverbed, turned his head to look around as if looking for something, looked for a while to me to extend a hand. I understood the head down from the body of a vest pocket pulled out the mask, and from another pocket pulled out the gloves, rummaging and took out a ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you are really prepared ah, is simply a mobile survey box, the survey box and heavy, commonly used on those few things but to carry, some places that is really hard ah, the future do not need to bring a box, bring you a enough. Dr. Sun watched with interest as I took out one thing after another from my body like a magic trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not make fun of me, let&rsquo;s see the body first. This full of pockets of the &ldquo;scene investigation&rdquo; vest in the pockets of all kinds of commonly used supplies, this is still the habit of the previous apprenticeship, otherwise sometimes to some inconvenient place to work with the box is very affected.</p>
<p>I also put on a pair of gloves, squatting down and began to find the zipper of the body bag. I did not expect to pull open the body bag, a huge wound on the top of the head appeared directly in front of our eyes, it looks like something hit out. Seeing this wound, Dr. Sun put away his smile just now, and his demeanor became serious.</p>
<p>Sun stopped me from reaching out to check the wound, and instead asked me to look through my pockets first, looking for ID cards, driver&rsquo;s licenses and other things that can prove identity. I found a cell phone in the pocket of the leather jacket worn by the deceased, and found a neatly folded 1447 yuan, a set of keys and a pack of cigarettes in the pocket of the lower body jeans, nothing to directly prove the identity of the things. Sun told me to put the phone in a separate evidence bag and put the rest back in place first: &ldquo;Take the body back and check it carefully, it&rsquo;s likely to be a case.</p>
<p>Deep and shallow to carry the body on the bridge, the investigation colleagues immediately gathered around and asked: &ldquo;Well? Is it a case?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet, but you&rsquo;d better be prepared. This cell phone for you, go first to determine the source of the body. Hearing the words of forensic scientist Sun, the colleagues of the investigation have expressed their unhappiness.</p>
<p>Before leaving the scene, forensic scientist Sun again saw the small civilian police, to him a frown: &ldquo;can not be? Really a case ah?&rdquo; The young police officer was immediately nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems you have to stay at the scene for a while longer. The police officer said, &ldquo;I need an autopsy to be sure.</p>
<p>Back to the autopsy room, Dr. Sun took out two sets of disposable surgical gowns and handed me a set: &ldquo;The first few times I saw you do pretty well, today you&rsquo;ll be the main knife, I&rsquo;ll be your assistant.</p>
<p>Usually corpse inspection requires at least two people to cooperate with each other to complete, generally will stand on the right hand side of the corpse called the &ldquo;main knife&rdquo;, because the right hand holds the knife, then, from this direction to operate from head to toe, relatively smooth, and the main knife is also the main examination and report the autopsy findings of the person.</p>
<p>Dress up, put on the mask, gloves, first surface inspection of the body. After taking off all the clothes, what caught the eye was one after another old scars, and a tattoo was found on the arm. I and Sun forensic medicine with the body rinsed clean, towel dry water stains, Sun forensic medicine turned to take pictures of colleagues said: &ldquo;the face and the tattoo first photographed and sent to the investigation, to provide them with some clues to find people again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you to determine the time of his death. Hearing the question of Sun forensic pathologist, my heart is a little bottomless, although these are learned in professional classes, but really put the theory into practice, or a little less confident.</p>
<p>According to the textbook, the time of death in the early stages of death can be inferred from measuring the temperature of the body, but the body is soaked in water, relying on the temperature may deviate more. In addition to the temperature of the corpse, can also be inferred from some early corpse phenomena, including the formation of the site of rigor mortis, intensity, press the corpse spot can fade, check the degree of corneal clouding, and so on. When undressing just now, we found that the limbs were not much stiffness, pressed the chin of the corpse, and raised the head, and found that there was a little stiffness in the jaw and neck. The back of the corpse spot can fade with a light press. Pick up the tweezers to turn over the eyelids, the cornea is clear and transparent, no clouding at all.</p>
<p>After doing the above, I silently thought for a moment, looked up at the clock on the wall: &ldquo;I think the time of death should be less than 5 hours, it is now 10:25, that &hellip;&hellip; probably died at about 5:00 this morning. The first thing you need to do is look at Dr. Sun with a little bit of weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, theoretically okay. Sun forensic doctor first affirmed my answer, &ldquo;but I think the time can be set a little longer, more than 6 hours it. The weather is not too hot, and the body is soaking in the water, in the low temperature environment stiffness will appear a little slower. And, I don&rsquo;t know if you noticed, at the scene, his face was dark red, at that time did not look closely at the injury or other, but now you see, the dark red face has faded a lot, so this should be the corpse spots, the back also appeared corpse spots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know! At the scene, the body is lying prone in the water, according to reason corpse spots should appear in front of the body, chest, face such, so then at the scene to see the face of the dark red should be corpse spots, but now the face of the corpse spots disappeared, but the back appeared corpse spots, this is the phenomenon of transfer of corpse spots. After Dr. Sun&rsquo;s reminder, I remembered a phenomenon when the corpse spots first began to form.</p>
<p>Continuing to check the body surface, there were some small abrasions on the face, mainly concentrated on the nose, the arch of the eyebrows, and the temporal region (located on both sides of the head, behind both eyes, and above the cheekbones, which is roughly the area near the temples). There were also some small abrasions on the back of the left hand and bilateral knees. The abrasions had a clear reaction to life, indicating that they should have been caused prenatally.</p>
<p>The body surface, apart from these minor abrasions, left the large trauma on the top of the head. I inserted a cotton swab into the wound and wiped around, and took it out and found some black sediment-like material on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no characteristic, the body is soaking in the river, the river&rsquo;s sediment or something inevitably washed in by the water, if you find some brick chips, wood chips and so on can also explain some problems. Despite what Dr. Sun said, or let the photo colleagues to take pictures of the mud and sand above the swab fixed.</p>
<p>I rinsed the wound with water and aligned the edges, and found that the entire wound was roughly in the shape of a &ldquo;χ&rdquo;, with the scalp and skull separated in the middle of the cross, and extending deeper to the sides, presenting a pouch-like appearance between the scalp and the skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trauma base was uneven, the trauma margin was not smooth, and there were intertissue bridges between the trauma walls.&rdquo; I reported these findings while examining, &ldquo;This is typical of blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is this pouch-like appearance?&rdquo; Dr. Sun asked again.</p>
<p>I searched my mind and thought about what I had read in books and what the teacher had said in class, but there was no mention of blunt force trauma showing such signs, so I shook my head and said I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finally got it!&rdquo; Dr. Sun laughed, &ldquo;this performance is generally caused by a relatively large area of objects, previously encountered an iron plate slapped on the head, also appeared this performance. It does not matter, forensics is practice, see more naturally know.</p>
<p>The next step is to dissect, after cutting open the scalp, see the sagittal suture of the skull (located at the top of the human head, a longitudinal bone seam from front to back) and the left side of the herringbone suture (a horizontal bone seam located at the back of the head) has been cracked. After removing the skull, there was a thin layer of hematoma outside the dura on the right side, and there was hemorrhage from the subarachnoid space in both the prefrontal location of the brain and the cerebellum.</p>
<p>When I did this, I thought to myself, &ldquo;This was clearly hit with a blunt object of the type that the teacher just described, so this person was killed and then dumped in the river! I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s it! This must be the case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the head, the thoracic and abdominal cavities were opened next. The surface of the lungs in the chest cavity had obvious indentation of the ribs, and there was a &ldquo;twisted hair&rdquo; feeling when squeezed by hand (kind of like squeezing a lock of hair and twisting it around), and red bloody fluid came out of the cut surface of the lungs. When the esophagus was opened, there was a small amount of sediment-like material adhering to the wall of the esophagus. The trachea was cut open and a large amount of white foamy fluid was found in the trachea. In the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum on the surface of the spleen was crumpled and the entire spleen was anemic in appearance. Other than that, there were no abnormal findings.</p>
<p>After the autopsy, I was confused again: the damage seen in the head was enough to cause the person to die of cranio-cerebral injury, thinking that there would be no additional findings in the chest and abdominal cavity, but how come there were so many manifestations of drowning death by entering the water before birth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teacher, this person&rsquo;s lungs showed typical signs of &ldquo;watery emphysema&rdquo;, and sediment and foam were found in the esophagus and trachea, as well as anemia of the spleen. These are all signs of drowning. I began to feel a little dizzy, so I had to ask the teacher for help, &ldquo;The injury on this person&rsquo;s head was caused by a blunt instrument, but this was followed by the manifestations of drowning. So, how exactly is the cause of death determined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun forensics did not directly answer my question, if thought for a while, decided to go back to the scene to see.</p>
<p>Back to the scene, I and Sun forensic yards of highway, from one side to find the other, but did not find any useful information. Forensic scientist Sun and I were lying on the railing looking at the position of the body in the water in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teacher.&rdquo; I broke the silence first, &ldquo;this person has a large head wound, such a large wound bleeding must be very ferocious, if it was wounded here, then the ground should leave a blood trail, right? Even if this is just a body dumping site, the transfer process should also have blood left ah. Could it be that it was floated down from upstream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sun forensic doctor as if I did not hear what I was saying, lit a cigarette and still looking at the river dazed. I look at the water, and then look at Sun forensic, and did not know what he was looking at.</p>
<p>A cigarette soon finished, Dr. Sun casually threw into the river, the cigarette sank in the water and floated away with the current. Suddenly, Dr. Sun &ldquo;Huh&rdquo;, asked me: &ldquo;There is paper?</p>
<p>I am more puzzled, turned out a packet of Kleenex handed to Sun forensics, he pulled out a ball into a small ball, like just threw the paper into the river, the ball of paper floated away with the current, and the direction of the floating away is - the second bridge pier!</p>
<p>I stared at the ball of paper seemed to think of something, grabbed the tissue paper in the hands of Dr. Sun, also pulled out a ball into a ball and threw it down, the ball of paper once again drifted to the second pier there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the flow of the river, it really is floating down from above. I was a little frustrated, this kind of &ldquo;river drift&rdquo; often brings trouble to solve the case. Sometimes it&rsquo;s even a problem to identify the person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; I think this is not a case now, but I need to get the fire department to confirm a few questions first. Forensic scientist Sun took out his cell phone and started calling the fire department in the morning, asking questions about the riverbed and the depth of the water.</p>
<p>After hanging up the phone, Dr. Sun said to me happily, &ldquo;I have an answer, they told me that the riverbed under the bridge is different from the rocky beach on the shore, the riverbed here is flat, basically no rocks, just a big concrete slab! And, there is an important information, they went down in the morning, the deepest water is just to the calf, the river is not much deeper!</p>
<p>Listened to the words of Sun Forensic, I immediately understood his meaning; the body head injury is not at all hit by others with blunt instruments, but from the bridge jumped to the river high fall formed. Because the river is not deep, the deceased&rsquo;s head directly on the flat riverbed formed the head of that large wound, and this impact did not let him die immediately, only because of cranial damage and fainted, after the drowning occurred, and finally washed by the water to the second pier under the location of the body was found.</p>
<p>Later investigators retrieved the highway surveillance video, the video shows 4:42 in the morning, a figure appeared on the bridge, in the bridge from one end to the other, back and forth several times after walking, stopped at the guardrail looking at the bridge below, about 5 minutes later over the guardrail, and then fell head first. Because of the distance, coupled with dim street lights, it is impossible to see the face, but look very much like the deceased dressed. Later contacted the family of the deceased through the cell phone card has not been damaged, the family confirmed that the person in the video is the deceased.</p>
<p>Finally, the cause of death on the forensic medical opinion was written: &ldquo;cranio-cerebral injury due to high fall, combined with drowning death&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this &ldquo;case&rdquo;, my mind was limited to the first sight of the head wound, while preconceived notions that the wound was inflicted with a blunt object because of its obvious blunt force trait. But just like the final result, blunt force injury is not necessarily a blunt object to hit the head, hitting the head with a blunt object can also be formed, so that the &ldquo;sac-like&rdquo; performance under the wound can also be explained through, the flat riverbed acted as a special blunt object. Moreover, because of the buffering effect of the river also makes the body does not appear in the high fall in the often occurring multiple fractures, internal organs also did not appear obvious rupture, lost a lot of high fall injury characteristics.</p>
<p>This once again reflects the forensic not only to pay attention to the body itself, but also to pay attention to the situation of the scene environment, to avoid the first conclusion and then find evidence of the way of thinking, to think outside the box to crack the problem.</p>
