  "articleBody": " July 1993.\nI don’t even know how many times the police had a case analysis meeting.\nDuring this month, various clues were collected one after another.\nFirst, Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, gave the police a headache. Originally, the police ruled him out, after all, the second murder, he had an absolute alibi. As for why there was a human head and murder weapon in his house? Why did the murderer have to leave his name at the scene? The police have not yet come to a conclusion, some suspect that perhaps the killer had an axe to grind with him.\nOriginally also let him go, Ma Sanshui, taking into account various reasons, also sent a police officer, 24-hour “protection” of him.\nThe problem is that one night in late July, Zhang Jianjun disappeared. Right under the officer’s nose, he took the opportunity to go to the toilet in the courtyard and disappeared. And the police searched with all their might for three days, even to his old home, but could not find him again.\nDid he escape over the courtyard wall by himself? But why did he do that?\nBeard thought: this master or a ghost in his heart, there must be a suspicion!\nSecond, say the source of the body on. Because the first dead man’s head was found, the police gave it a restoration, but also finally found.\nThe deceased was actually a demented, had been in the city to ask for food. This also explains, why his body stinks!\nThe police therefore made a bold speculation, the second body, should also be a demented person.\nAlthough so far, no heads have been found, not locked the source of the corpse, but the Baoshan County police asked for help from the provincial department, sent a big forensic doctor. I do not know how this big forensic doctor in the end, I heard that she also once studied the body’s teeth and anus, and finally she concluded that the deceased is also a demented person.\nFinally, the news of the killer. Unfortunately, there is nothing! Not even an eyewitness!\nIn order to be able to solve the case, the next not to mention the police, we are the eyes and ears are not idle.\nIn Baoshan County, especially in the White Village, a large number of people were deployed to visit and investigate during the day, and patrol and set up checkpoints at night.\nSome of the other eyes and ears dressed as demented, were assigned to different places to go along the streets to beg for a living.\nOriginally the beard once also dressed up, but he simply is not that material. Kneeling in the street, his eyes lit up when he saw the more trendy, especially in bell-bottom pants lesbians. This is by no means the standard for dementia!\nAnd above all, we also kept an eye on the really demented people. But this kind of people, at that time in Baoshan County is not a lot, the police got hold of, there are more than thirty.\nThis also shows how important eugenics is.\nOf course, we suffered at the same time, also once thought that such a high-intensity network of heaven and earth, the killer will not be able to hide for too long.\nBut in fact, he continued to be unscrupulous.\nIn late July 1993, a headless man’s body was found hanging in an abandoned explosives house in a precinct called Yangzhen. The murderer left a note on the spot: “I, Zhang Jianjun! Killed the beast!”\nIn early August, one also appeared next to a water pond called Xiaojia Village. And I saw a row of blood at the scene, the kind of sparse blood spots. It stretched from underneath the corpse to the middle of the pond.\nOn the corpse, this time there was a white cloth hanging directly over it, on which was written, “Come to me! Zhang Jianjun!”\nAugust 11, 1993.\nThe police suspected that there were important clues inside the pond, especially since three more heads had not been found in these four murders.\nSo the police brought in fire trucks and large pumps to prepare to suck the pond dry.\nAnd I, bitterly, became the night duty officer.\nWe all know how uncomfortable such places are at night, in the middle of summer, it’s full of mosquitoes.\nI had to put on a thick windbreaker, although hot, but gritted his teeth and held on. Also lit two trays of mosquito incense beside me.\nThe night is not lonely for me. At the same time, many other eyes and ears are also in different posts guard.\nWe use the walkie-talkie, looking at each other from a distance, but also to pass the time.\nAt two o’clock in the night, the beard looked for me again.\nOriginally he was purely pulling useless, a moment to talk to me about the girl’s flower skirt, and a moment to say which widow in Baoshan County’s doorstep right and wrong, etc..\nI criticized him: “Comrade! Let you visit, is to solve the case, look at you, what have you investigated?”\nHu Zi hehe smiled, then a change of topic.\n“Lao Ge, have you heard? This afternoon, the local police passed the case information to the provinces, supposedly looking for a criminal psychology master to analyze it. Hey! Another master oh!”\nAt the end, he deliberately in the “master” on the tone of voice.\nI did not think the same as he did. This master is not the other master, the police can find, that must have two brilliance.\nI asked him to continue and tell how the psychologist followed up the analysis.\nAcross the street suddenly came a pop, I guess he was hitting the mosquitoes.\nThen he: “This master said that the police were wrong before the direction, the killer is taking care of the body, not simply in the abuse of the body. Listen, is it a fart? All hang the body as a red flag, and cut off the head, is not the abuse of the corpse is what?”\nI hesitated for a moment, but still asked, “The expert did not explain why?”\nBeard thought for a long time, and then said: “seems to have something to do with the knife, right? That master said, the four corpses on the neck wound is very detailed, like …… right right, surgery! General murder, are under a vicious hand, a few knives or a few axes to cut off the head, and this murderer it, using all the small broken knife, like surgery, a little cut, so the wound on the neck of the corpse will look very flat, even very neat.”\nBeard came up with a vomiting look: “Lao Ge, you say amusing, but also psychological experts, can the killer’s modus operandi so literary, I also heard for the first time!”\nAnd I fell into contemplation, also recalled.\nYes! The corpse’s neck is indeed the same as the expert described.\nThe beard originally continued to want to spit all kinds of, presumably want to take the expert as a fun.\nBut I did not give him the opportunity, but instead asked: “What else did the expert say? You kid one by one, tell me what you know.”\nI could feel that the beard became very uninteresting, but then he also stressed: “The experts let the police change the routine, do not be traditional, especially do not investigate after the crime, but also do not simply cast a large net. Experts concluded that this time, facing a killer with a twisted mind, it is likely that he has his own set of theories and laws, so it is necessary to know him to know me.”\n“That’s called knowing yourself and knowing your enemy!” I interjected and corrected.\n“Right, right! And you’re educated!” Beard nodded and continued, “The expert concluded that the criminal had some connection with Zhang Jianjun, not as simple as simply having a grudge or something like that. And driven by this unique psychology, the killer will continue to commit the crime, so experts reminded the police to strengthen the investigation and control of such people. In addition it is said ha, experts continue to study again, trying to analyze as soon as possible more about the psychology of criminals, to this side of the police to pass over.”\nI was silent, the beard must be something else at this point, he turned off the intercom.\nIn fact, since being the eyes and ears, I have been vaguely aware of a problem, and really just like the experts said, we are too passive.\nWhen it comes to ordinary murder cases, which is fine, but when faced with this “abnormal” murderer, also because we can not capture his true psychology, so we have been led by the nose.\n(It was not until ‘94 that the domestic police overhauled and introduced criminal psychology. (Before that, most of the places are mainly based on traditional crime solving methods.)\nOriginally, I followed the expert’s thinking, and then pondered up on their own, to see with their own brains, can not have any good ideas, but inadvertently a look up, I found a dark shadow in the woods by the pond.\nI do not know when he came, anyway, just standing there, has been looking at me.\n“Who?” I shouted.\nHe waved his hand, looking anxious, and was urging me to go over.\nBecause the distance is too far, even with a flashlight shake, I can not see the person’s face.\nAfter he urged again, he also turned around and walked away first.\nI’m afraid it’s a villager or something, but it’s hard to believe that the folks have found something again?\nI tucked away the walkie-talkie and hurried over.\nThe woods were relatively dense and leafy, and after going deeper into them, I had a terrible view.\n“Hey!” I shouted, also waiting for the man’s response.\nBut apart from hearing a few old crow calls, there was nothing else.\n“Going so fast!” I muttered and was wondering what to do next.\nThere was a drop, and a small piece of my head was wet.\n“It’s raining?” I touched it in wonder, and raised my head in passing.\nBut that’s the move, bad!\nI watched as a man squatted in the branches of the tree above my head. And he had thrown a piece of white stuff down.\nThe force was great, and the speed was fast.\nWith a snap, it whole paste in my face.\nWhat a sweet taste! Only one bite down, my legs went weak, and the whole sky spun in front of me.\nI remembered that the pat flower, is the nineties a con man on the street the usual means. To put it bluntly, that are very potent ecstasy.\nSee me stagger this is going to fall, the branch of the tree this man leapt down.\nHe also took a few quick steps to try to help me.\n“Careful! The ground is hard!” He repeatedly said twice.\nAt this point, I could not open my mouth, I could only open my heart and greet his ancestors once. Because he was the one who knocked me out, and then he came to play the good guy!\nThe moment I was about to close my eyes, I also saw him touch his waist, pulled out an iron hook!\nOriginally I thought I was dead. Any fool would know that I had met the right man! He had the audacity to sneak back to the scene of the crime in the night, to revisit a former place.\nBut after some confused sleep, I woke up.\nI found myself in an abandoned house, the sky seemed to be just dawn, so the house was not so dark.\nAt that moment I heard again, it seemed that someone was talking. I slowly turned my head to look.\nThis is a man of about thirty years old, not much character, is placed in the crowd are not conspicuous kind. At this moment, he looked lazy, leaning against the window, holding my walkie-talkie, and was chatting with other earthers.\nMy head buzzed and I finally remembered it all.\nI tried to struggle, tried to scream. The problem was that I was tied up and had a piece of duct tape stuck to my mouth.\nHe had noticed my movements, but just grinned and nodded at me.\nAt this moment, I froze, my brain also whooshed to see sweat.\nTo be honest, this performance of the murderer made me scared! If at this point he is smiling and vicious, for me, but nothing, this kind of evil people, in fact, not so difficult to communicate.\nI’m afraid to meet this kind of in front of me, because he is too perverse!\nI struggled some more and then gave up. After all, it is better to leave some strength.\nI’m also watching and even listening to him.\nIn fact, for this case, we have these eyes and ears from all directions, most of them are not familiar with each other. This is cheap for the killer.\nWhenever he spoke, everyone treated him as one of their own.\nWe all had a mixed conversation, but soon, the beard popped up and also said one of the latest developments.\n“Guys, the police have sent word again that the psycho-guru has made a judgment, and he thinks the reason the killer killed demented people was to give them a break! Let these types of people suffer less in this world, so that explains why the killer provided a rich dinner for the deceased before killing them, and even dressed them in such neat clothes.”\n“Correct me, it’s a military uniform! It was produced by the Baoshan Garment Factory, and it was the best that this factory could produce.” The killer suddenly interjected.\nNot only the beard, everyone eeked.\n“How do you know so well, brother?” Beard asked curiously.\nThe murderer grinned: “I just heard from the police, too.”\n“Can not ah, we this piece, I am the messenger ah.” Hu Zi muttered a sentence.\nThe murderer deliberately digressed, let the beard continue to talk about the psychological master.\nBeard: “The master guessed again that the murderer is likely to be a qigong enthusiast, which is why he left that tape at the scene. As for that screw, there is probably nothing special about it, because demented patients, like children, like to grab something to play with.”\n“Tsk!” The killer deliberately so a few sounds. “This master is not bad, at least much better than fortune tellers. In fact, his analysis is similar to what I thought.”\nAfter a pause in his voice, he continued: “I’ll tell you my opinion. That screw, must be used to play, the deceased was not honest at the time, can only use this screw, to distract his attention.”\n“As for qigong enthusiasts, this well, I think the master said wrong, the killer will not qigong, the reason for the existence of that tape, because Zhang Jianjun once advertised that his qigong function to cure all diseases, including brain disease, of course, so the killer held the attitude of curing and saving people, to the deceased played the tape several times, and the results, simply useless!”\nIntercom silence up.\nI just feel that time has suddenly frozen with the same.\nThis is also the first time I saw, the killer took the initiative to introduce the case and suspicion.\nAfter a few seconds, the beard came up with an interested look: “Man, I think you go to be a psychological master can be okay, your analysis is very incisive, to meet, which prison out of the previous?”\nThe killer laughed.\nAnd I was angry, that is, I could not see the beard, or quasi-choke him to death. Along with this, I also scolded these are using the walkie-talkie earpiece, how each head with a mallet, no one reacted to it?\nNext, the killer took the place of the master and talked to everyone about his unique analysis.\n“First of all, why the killer cut off the head of the deceased, because it is the head of the trouble. It was broken! That’s why the deceased suffered in this life, living like an animal, not experiencing the happiness of a normal human being.”\n“Secondly, the reason why the body was hung. This is actually a very sacred practice, because the murderer hopes that the deceased will ascend to heaven after death and be reincarnated in the next life!”\n“As for why leave a name at the scene, it is very simple, the murderer did such a good thing, it is difficult to learn from Lei Feng? Do good deeds do not leave a name?” Of course, at the end of the day, many ears are curious, say no, the murderer is obviously planted, leaving the name of qigong master Zhang Jianjun at the scene.\nThe murderer shook his head vigorously and questioned, “called Zhang Jianjun must refer to the fake master? Can’t the murderer himself be called Zhang Jianjun?”\nPredictably, his analysis, and finally won the praise of all, especially the beard, the stupid bastard also said: “Brother, brain enough! I’m convinced! Drink one together some day!”\nAnd I, during this period is absolutely suffering, the heart is almost suffocating to explode!\nI saw that everyone was going to break up the game. I know, I do not do something, it will be too late!\n",

</ol>
<p>July 1993.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how many times the police had a case analysis meeting.</p>
<p>During this month, various clues were collected one after another.</p>
<p>First, Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, gave the police a headache. Originally, the police ruled him out, after all, the second murder, he had an absolute alibi. As for why there was a human head and murder weapon in his house? Why did the murderer have to leave his name at the scene? The police have not yet come to a conclusion, some suspect that perhaps the killer had an axe to grind with him.</p>
<p>Originally also let him go, Ma Sanshui, taking into account various reasons, also sent a police officer, 24-hour &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of him.</p>
<p>The problem is that one night in late July, Zhang Jianjun disappeared. Right under the officer&rsquo;s nose, he took the opportunity to go to the toilet in the courtyard and disappeared. And the police searched with all their might for three days, even to his old home, but could not find him again.</p>
<p>Did he escape over the courtyard wall by himself? But why did he do that?</p>
<p>Beard thought: this master or a ghost in his heart, there must be a suspicion!</p>
<p>Second, say the source of the body on. Because the first dead man&rsquo;s head was found, the police gave it a restoration, but also finally found.</p>
<p>The deceased was actually a demented, had been in the city to ask for food. This also explains, why his body stinks!</p>
<p>The police therefore made a bold speculation, the second body, should also be a demented person.</p>
<p>Although so far, no heads have been found, not locked the source of the corpse, but the Baoshan County police asked for help from the provincial department, sent a big forensic doctor. I do not know how this big forensic doctor in the end, I heard that she also once studied the body&rsquo;s teeth and anus, and finally she concluded that the deceased is also a demented person.</p>
<p>Finally, the news of the killer. Unfortunately, there is nothing! Not even an eyewitness!</p>
<p>In order to be able to solve the case, the next not to mention the police, we are the eyes and ears are not idle.</p>
<p>In Baoshan County, especially in the White Village, a large number of people were deployed to visit and investigate during the day, and patrol and set up checkpoints at night.</p>
<p>Some of the other eyes and ears dressed as demented, were assigned to different places to go along the streets to beg for a living.</p>
<p>Originally the beard once also dressed up, but he simply is not that material. Kneeling in the street, his eyes lit up when he saw the more trendy, especially in bell-bottom pants lesbians. This is by no means the standard for dementia!</p>
<p>And above all, we also kept an eye on the really demented people. But this kind of people, at that time in Baoshan County is not a lot, the police got hold of, there are more than thirty.</p>
<p>This also shows how important eugenics is.</p>
<p>Of course, we suffered at the same time, also once thought that such a high-intensity network of heaven and earth, the killer will not be able to hide for too long.</p>
<p>But in fact, he continued to be unscrupulous.</p>
<p>In late July 1993, a headless man&rsquo;s body was found hanging in an abandoned explosives house in a precinct called Yangzhen. The murderer left a note on the spot: &ldquo;I, Zhang Jianjun! Killed the beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In early August, one also appeared next to a water pond called Xiaojia Village. And I saw a row of blood at the scene, the kind of sparse blood spots. It stretched from underneath the corpse to the middle of the pond.</p>
<p>On the corpse, this time there was a white cloth hanging directly over it, on which was written, &ldquo;Come to me! Zhang Jianjun!&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>August 11, 1993.</p>
<p>The police suspected that there were important clues inside the pond, especially since three more heads had not been found in these four murders.</p>
<p>So the police brought in fire trucks and large pumps to prepare to suck the pond dry.</p>
<p>And I, bitterly, became the night duty officer.</p>
<p>We all know how uncomfortable such places are at night, in the middle of summer, it&rsquo;s full of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I had to put on a thick windbreaker, although hot, but gritted his teeth and held on. Also lit two trays of mosquito incense beside me.</p>
<p>The night is not lonely for me. At the same time, many other eyes and ears are also in different posts guard.</p>
<p>We use the walkie-talkie, looking at each other from a distance, but also to pass the time.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the night, the beard looked for me again.</p>
<p>Originally he was purely pulling useless, a moment to talk to me about the girl&rsquo;s flower skirt, and a moment to say which widow in Baoshan County&rsquo;s doorstep right and wrong, etc..</p>
<p>I criticized him: &ldquo;Comrade! Let you visit, is to solve the case, look at you, what have you investigated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hu Zi hehe smiled, then a change of topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lao Ge, have you heard? This afternoon, the local police passed the case information to the provinces, supposedly looking for a criminal psychology master to analyze it. Hey! Another master oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end, he deliberately in the &ldquo;master&rdquo; on the tone of voice.</p>
<p>I did not think the same as he did. This master is not the other master, the police can find, that must have two brilliance.</p>
<p>I asked him to continue and tell how the psychologist followed up the analysis.</p>
<p>Across the street suddenly came a pop, I guess he was hitting the mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Then he: &ldquo;This master said that the police were wrong before the direction, the killer is taking care of the body, not simply in the abuse of the body. Listen, is it a fart? All hang the body as a red flag, and cut off the head, is not the abuse of the corpse is what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, but still asked, &ldquo;The expert did not explain why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beard thought for a long time, and then said: &ldquo;seems to have something to do with the knife, right? That master said, the four corpses on the neck wound is very detailed, like &hellip;&hellip; right right, surgery! General murder, are under a vicious hand, a few knives or a few axes to cut off the head, and this murderer it, using all the small broken knife, like surgery, a little cut, so the wound on the neck of the corpse will look very flat, even very neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beard came up with a vomiting look: &ldquo;Lao Ge, you say amusing, but also psychological experts, can the killer&rsquo;s modus operandi so literary, I also heard for the first time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I fell into contemplation, also recalled.</p>
<p>Yes! The corpse&rsquo;s neck is indeed the same as the expert described.</p>
<p>The beard originally continued to want to spit all kinds of, presumably want to take the expert as a fun.</p>
<p>But I did not give him the opportunity, but instead asked: &ldquo;What else did the expert say? You kid one by one, tell me what you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could feel that the beard became very uninteresting, but then he also stressed: &ldquo;The experts let the police change the routine, do not be traditional, especially do not investigate after the crime, but also do not simply cast a large net. Experts concluded that this time, facing a killer with a twisted mind, it is likely that he has his own set of theories and laws, so it is necessary to know him to know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s called knowing yourself and knowing your enemy!&rdquo; I interjected and corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, right! And you&rsquo;re educated!&rdquo; Beard nodded and continued, &ldquo;The expert concluded that the criminal had some connection with Zhang Jianjun, not as simple as simply having a grudge or something like that. And driven by this unique psychology, the killer will continue to commit the crime, so experts reminded the police to strengthen the investigation and control of such people. In addition it is said ha, experts continue to study again, trying to analyze as soon as possible more about the psychology of criminals, to this side of the police to pass over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was silent, the beard must be something else at this point, he turned off the intercom.</p>
<p>In fact, since being the eyes and ears, I have been vaguely aware of a problem, and really just like the experts said, we are too passive.</p>
<p>When it comes to ordinary murder cases, which is fine, but when faced with this &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; murderer, also because we can not capture his true psychology, so we have been led by the nose.</p>
<p>(It was not until &lsquo;94 that the domestic police overhauled and introduced criminal psychology. (Before that, most of the places are mainly based on traditional crime solving methods.)</p>
<p>Originally, I followed the expert&rsquo;s thinking, and then pondered up on their own, to see with their own brains, can not have any good ideas, but inadvertently a look up, I found a dark shadow in the woods by the pond.</p>
<p>I do not know when he came, anyway, just standing there, has been looking at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I shouted.</p>
<p>He waved his hand, looking anxious, and was urging me to go over.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the distance is too far, even with a flashlight shake, I can not see the person&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>After he urged again, he also turned around and walked away first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a villager or something, but it&rsquo;s hard to believe that the folks have found something again?</p>
<p>I tucked away the walkie-talkie and hurried over.</p>
<p>The woods were relatively dense and leafy, and after going deeper into them, I had a terrible view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; I shouted, also waiting for the man&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>But apart from hearing a few old crow calls, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going so fast!&rdquo; I muttered and was wondering what to do next.</p>
<p>There was a drop, and a small piece of my head was wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining?&rdquo; I touched it in wonder, and raised my head in passing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the move, bad!</p>
<p>I watched as a man squatted in the branches of the tree above my head. And he had thrown a piece of white stuff down.</p>
<p>The force was great, and the speed was fast.</p>
<p>With a snap, it whole paste in my face.</p>
<p>What a sweet taste! Only one bite down, my legs went weak, and the whole sky spun in front of me.</p>
<p>I remembered that the pat flower, is the nineties a con man on the street the usual means. To put it bluntly, that are very potent ecstasy.</p>
<p>See me stagger this is going to fall, the branch of the tree this man leapt down.</p>
<p>He also took a few quick steps to try to help me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful! The ground is hard!&rdquo; He repeatedly said twice.</p>
<p>At this point, I could not open my mouth, I could only open my heart and greet his ancestors once. Because he was the one who knocked me out, and then he came to play the good guy!</p>
<p>The moment I was about to close my eyes, I also saw him touch his waist, pulled out an iron hook!</p>
<p>Originally I thought I was dead. Any fool would know that I had met the right man! He had the audacity to sneak back to the scene of the crime in the night, to revisit a former place.</p>
<p>But after some confused sleep, I woke up.</p>
<p>I found myself in an abandoned house, the sky seemed to be just dawn, so the house was not so dark.</p>
<p>At that moment I heard again, it seemed that someone was talking. I slowly turned my head to look.</p>
<p>This is a man of about thirty years old, not much character, is placed in the crowd are not conspicuous kind. At this moment, he looked lazy, leaning against the window, holding my walkie-talkie, and was chatting with other earthers.</p>
<p>My head buzzed and I finally remembered it all.</p>
<p>I tried to struggle, tried to scream. The problem was that I was tied up and had a piece of duct tape stuck to my mouth.</p>
<p>He had noticed my movements, but just grinned and nodded at me.</p>
<p>At this moment, I froze, my brain also whooshed to see sweat.</p>
<p>To be honest, this performance of the murderer made me scared! If at this point he is smiling and vicious, for me, but nothing, this kind of evil people, in fact, not so difficult to communicate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid to meet this kind of in front of me, because he is too perverse!</p>
<ol start="10">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I struggled some more and then gave up. After all, it is better to leave some strength.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also watching and even listening to him.</p>
<p>In fact, for this case, we have these eyes and ears from all directions, most of them are not familiar with each other. This is cheap for the killer.</p>
<p>Whenever he spoke, everyone treated him as one of their own.</p>
<p>We all had a mixed conversation, but soon, the beard popped up and also said one of the latest developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys, the police have sent word again that the psycho-guru has made a judgment, and he thinks the reason the killer killed demented people was to give them a break! Let these types of people suffer less in this world, so that explains why the killer provided a rich dinner for the deceased before killing them, and even dressed them in such neat clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct me, it&rsquo;s a military uniform! It was produced by the Baoshan Garment Factory, and it was the best that this factory could produce.&rdquo; The killer suddenly interjected.</p>
<p>Not only the beard, everyone eeked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know so well, brother?&rdquo; Beard asked curiously.</p>
<p>The murderer grinned: &ldquo;I just heard from the police, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can not ah, we this piece, I am the messenger ah.&rdquo; Hu Zi muttered a sentence.</p>
<p>The murderer deliberately digressed, let the beard continue to talk about the psychological master.</p>
<p>Beard: &ldquo;The master guessed again that the murderer is likely to be a qigong enthusiast, which is why he left that tape at the scene. As for that screw, there is probably nothing special about it, because demented patients, like children, like to grab something to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tsk!&rdquo; The killer deliberately so a few sounds. &ldquo;This master is not bad, at least much better than fortune tellers. In fact, his analysis is similar to what I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause in his voice, he continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you my opinion. That screw, must be used to play, the deceased was not honest at the time, can only use this screw, to distract his attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for qigong enthusiasts, this well, I think the master said wrong, the killer will not qigong, the reason for the existence of that tape, because Zhang Jianjun once advertised that his qigong function to cure all diseases, including brain disease, of course, so the killer held the attitude of curing and saving people, to the deceased played the tape several times, and the results, simply useless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Intercom silence up.</p>
<p>I just feel that time has suddenly frozen with the same.</p>
<p>This is also the first time I saw, the killer took the initiative to introduce the case and suspicion.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, the beard came up with an interested look: &ldquo;Man, I think you go to be a psychological master can be okay, your analysis is very incisive, to meet, which prison out of the previous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The killer laughed.</p>
<p>And I was angry, that is, I could not see the beard, or quasi-choke him to death. Along with this, I also scolded these are using the walkie-talkie earpiece, how each head with a mallet, no one reacted to it?</p>
<p>Next, the killer took the place of the master and talked to everyone about his unique analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, why the killer cut off the head of the deceased, because it is the head of the trouble. It was broken! That&rsquo;s why the deceased suffered in this life, living like an animal, not experiencing the happiness of a normal human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly, the reason why the body was hung. This is actually a very sacred practice, because the murderer hopes that the deceased will ascend to heaven after death and be reincarnated in the next life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for why leave a name at the scene, it is very simple, the murderer did such a good thing, it is difficult to learn from Lei Feng? Do good deeds do not leave a name?&rdquo;
Of course, at the end of the day, many ears are curious, say no, the murderer is obviously planted, leaving the name of qigong master Zhang Jianjun at the scene.</p>
<p>The murderer shook his head vigorously and questioned, &ldquo;called Zhang Jianjun must refer to the fake master? Can&rsquo;t the murderer himself be called Zhang Jianjun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Predictably, his analysis, and finally won the praise of all, especially the beard, the stupid bastard also said: &ldquo;Brother, brain enough! I&rsquo;m convinced! Drink one together some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I, during this period is absolutely suffering, the heart is almost suffocating to explode!</p>
<p>I saw that everyone was going to break up the game. I know, I do not do something, it will be too late!</p>
