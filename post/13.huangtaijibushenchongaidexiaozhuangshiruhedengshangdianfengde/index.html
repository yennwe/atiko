One was Empress Dowager Cixi, the birth mother of the Tongzhi Emperor, who held the power of the dynasty for nearly half a century and was the de facto ruler of China during the late Qing Dynasty; the other was Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, the birth mother of the Shunzhi Emperor, who trained and assisted two generations of emperors, Shunzhi and Kangxi, and was an outstanding politician in the early Qing Dynasty. The lives of these two women brought a decisive impact on the rise and fall of the Qing dynasty. But compared to Cixi’s rise to power, Xiaozhuang’s path was much more tortuous.\nAt the age of thirteen, Xiaozhuang was given to Huang taiji by her brother in an uncompromising political marriage. At first, she was Huang taiji sealed as side Fujin, later Huang taiji inherited the Khanate, and she was sealed as the Western Palace Fujin, second only to the Grand Fujin Erdene Qiqiege. But with the expansion of Huang taiji’s harem, filial piety’s status gradually decline, even in Huang taiji emperor ranked to the end of the consort (west side Fujin), was only sealed as Zhuang Fei. Even later gave birth to the emperor’s ninth son Fulin, later the Shunzhi Emperor, filial piety Zhuang in the harem’s status has not been able to rise.\nBecause Huang taiji from the bottom of his heart actually did not like Xiao Zhuang, and above Xiao Zhuang Na Mu Zhong (West Grand Fujin) and Batma (East Side Fujin), are the widow of Mongolia Lindan Khan, these two women in marriage to Huang taiji, brought a lot of Lindan Khan’s clan and property, marry these two women, for Huang taiji in enlisting the Mongolian clan to provide great help, so their status in the harem, so they are not low. naturally will not be low. Further up, is long settled in the position of the Palace of Erdeni Qiqiege (king Fujin), and Xiaozhuang’s sister, Huang taiji’s life’s favorite woman Hailanzhu (East Grand Fujin), in the last position of Xiaozhuang, is not qualified to compare with them.\nHere, we want to focus on the relationship between Hailanzhu and Huang taiji. This woman married Huang taiji, is already 26 years old, Qing history experts generally believe that Hailanzhu and the two widows of lindan Khan, like the previous experience of marriage. But Huang taiji and hailanzhu’s union, not as another ordinary political marriage, but to give her the status of the harem number two. In Hailanzhu for him to give birth to the eighth son, Huang taiji is openly declared the child as the Crown Prince, but unfortunately the child did not live long before he passed away. Despite this, Huang taiji’s love for Hailanzhu did not decrease by half.\nLater Hailanzhu fell ill, learned the news of Huang taiji, at that time was led by Hong Chengchou and the Ming army in Songshan, Jinzhou duel, in order to accompany Hailanzhu, Huang taiji made a very irrational decision, put the front tens of thousands of troops in danger, day and night to rush back to Shengjing. It is said that Huang taiji on the road because of riding bumps, high blood pressure attack, nosebleeds can not stop flowing, he took a bowl on the horse then nosebleeds, full on pouring, do not care about their health. But even so, he did not catch a last glimpse of Hailanzhu, walking outside of Shengjing, Hailanzhu has died of illness. Grief, Huang taiji, so cry faint on the ground, for several days without food and drink, even later the Qing army captured Hong Chengchou, Zu Dashou, for the surrender of the two celebrated, Huang taiji because to mourn Hailanzhu, did not show up.\nIn contrast, Huang taiji’s favor to Xiaozhuang during his lifetime, almost negligible, there is no record in the history books about the feelings between Xiaozhuang and Huang taiji. But this is a harem of “small transparent”, after the death of Huang taiji but step by step to the fore, became the key figure in the early Qing dynasty national process.\nThe turning point in the fate of Xiaozhuang’s life occurred on September 21, 1643 AD.\nOn that day, the Qing emperor Huang taiji died suddenly in Shengjing at the age of 52. Because of the suddenness of the incident, he did not leave a will before his death, the issue of successor to the throne, became the focus of discussion.\nAt that time, the most powerful successor to the throne are two people. One is Huang taiji’s big brother, in charge of the Ministry of household affairs Su Prince Hauge, support him, mainly by Huang taiji direct command of the two yellow banners and blue banner generals, as well as Turg, Sony, Tu Lai, Ao Bai and a number of important courtiers. They believe that Hauge has made a lot of war, before Huang taiji was already Heshuo Baylor, after the emperor and promoted to Prince of Su, and his uncles on an equal footing, enough to prove that Huang taiji is willing to train him to succeed the throne.\nThe other is Huang taiji’s brother, in charge of the Ministry of Rui Prince Dorgon, and Hauge compared to Dorgon, although not Huang taiji’s children, but the generation is high, and more merit, two of his own brothers Azig and Doduo is also his hardcore supporters, has a white, set white two strong flag, many members of the clan also secretly support Dorgon ascension to the throne. These two groups of people for power, there was a sharp confrontation, once to the point of saber-rattling. At the time of the meeting, the two yellow banner ministers even entered the palace with weapons, claiming that if the eight banner masters choose someone other than Huang taiji’s son as emperor, then they have to kill themselves on the spot and follow the late emperor. Although the words are so said, but from the standpoint of Dorgon and other people listening, that means too clear: you Dorgon dare to touch the throne, we two yellow flag people fight for their lives, but also to kill you!\nAt this time, dorgon and hoge outside the third force came forward, the final attribution of the throne played a decisive role in guiding. Their names, is Dai Shan and Jierhalang. Dai Shan the man, as we mentioned earlier, is Nurhachu’s Great Baylor, he and his sons commanded the two red banners. In the eight banner king kilometers, Dai Shan’s seniority is the oldest, the highest status, strength is actually the most powerful in each flag lord. But after years of wind and rain polished Dai Shan, at this moment has nothing to covet the throne, someone in the meeting proposed to embrace him as the emperor, also by Dai Shan directly refused, and in between Dorgon, Hauge two people, Dai Shan also did not have a clear statement of which side to support.\nIn contrast, the flag owner of the paneled blue banner Jierhalang, although usually obsequious, a good old-fashioned look, but at this time showed a calm and sophisticated side. He believes that, although Hauge is more qualified than Dorgon to succeed the throne, but in the strength of the latter is not as good, and must be elected from the two people, the other side is bound to fierce opposition, is not conducive to the unity of the eight banners. Therefore, Jierhalang proposed a compromise program, embracing the same Huang taiji son of Fulin succeeded to the throne, before Fulin grows up to rule, by him and Dorgon jointly assist the government. In this way, loyal to Huang taiji Jierhalang, to ensure that Hauge and other people will not be Dorgon group retaliation, and Dorgon’s people do not have to worry about being liquidated.\nSure enough, this proposal was approved by all parties. Little Fulin’s birth mother Zhuang Fei, was also able to and Huang taiji’s Palace Queen of the two houses and honor, when the Empress Dowager. Later, with the Qing army, the sudden death of Dorgon, Kangxi reign and a series of events, the status of the Empress Dowager Xiao Zhuang also higher and higher, and finally got “unified two dynasties of filial piety, extremely three generations of respect for relatives,” the lofty status.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>In the history of the Qing Dynasty, there are two powerful women with whom we are most familiar. One was Empress Dowager Cixi, the birth mother of the Tongzhi Emperor, who held the power of the dynasty for nearly half a century and was the de facto ruler of China during the late Qing Dynasty; the other was Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, the birth mother of the Shunzhi Emperor, who trained and assisted two generations of emperors, Shunzhi and Kangxi, and was an outstanding politician in the early Qing Dynasty. The lives of these two women brought a decisive impact on the rise and fall of the Qing dynasty. But compared to Cixi&rsquo;s rise to power, Xiaozhuang&rsquo;s path was much more tortuous.</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen, Xiaozhuang was given to Huang taiji by her brother in an uncompromising political marriage. At first, she was Huang taiji sealed as side Fujin, later Huang taiji inherited the Khanate, and she was sealed as the Western Palace Fujin, second only to the Grand Fujin Erdene Qiqiege. But with the expansion of Huang taiji&rsquo;s harem, filial piety&rsquo;s status gradually decline, even in Huang taiji emperor ranked to the end of the consort (west side Fujin), was only sealed as Zhuang Fei. Even later gave birth to the emperor&rsquo;s ninth son Fulin, later the Shunzhi Emperor, filial piety Zhuang in the harem&rsquo;s status has not been able to rise.</p>
<p>Because Huang taiji from the bottom of his heart actually did not like Xiao Zhuang, and above Xiao Zhuang Na Mu Zhong (West Grand Fujin) and Batma (East Side Fujin), are the widow of Mongolia Lindan Khan, these two women in marriage to Huang taiji, brought a lot of Lindan Khan&rsquo;s clan and property, marry these two women, for Huang taiji in enlisting the Mongolian clan to provide great help, so their status in the harem, so they are not low. naturally will not be low. Further up, is long settled in the position of the Palace of Erdeni Qiqiege (king Fujin), and Xiaozhuang&rsquo;s sister, Huang taiji&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s favorite woman Hailanzhu (East Grand Fujin), in the last position of Xiaozhuang, is not qualified to compare with them.</p>
<p>Here, we want to focus on the relationship between Hailanzhu and Huang taiji. This woman married Huang taiji, is already 26 years old, Qing history experts generally believe that Hailanzhu and the two widows of lindan Khan, like the previous experience of marriage. But Huang taiji and hailanzhu&rsquo;s union, not as another ordinary political marriage, but to give her the status of the harem number two. In Hailanzhu for him to give birth to the eighth son, Huang taiji is openly declared the child as the Crown Prince, but unfortunately the child did not live long before he passed away. Despite this, Huang taiji&rsquo;s love for Hailanzhu did not decrease by half.</p>
<p>Later Hailanzhu fell ill, learned the news of Huang taiji, at that time was led by Hong Chengchou and the Ming army in Songshan, Jinzhou duel, in order to accompany Hailanzhu, Huang taiji made a very irrational decision, put the front tens of thousands of troops in danger, day and night to rush back to Shengjing. It is said that Huang taiji on the road because of riding bumps, high blood pressure attack, nosebleeds can not stop flowing, he took a bowl on the horse then nosebleeds, full on pouring, do not care about their health. But even so, he did not catch a last glimpse of Hailanzhu, walking outside of Shengjing, Hailanzhu has died of illness. Grief, Huang taiji, so cry faint on the ground, for several days without food and drink, even later the Qing army captured Hong Chengchou, Zu Dashou, for the surrender of the two celebrated, Huang taiji because to mourn Hailanzhu, did not show up.</p>
<p>In contrast, Huang taiji&rsquo;s favor to Xiaozhuang during his lifetime, almost negligible, there is no record in the history books about the feelings between Xiaozhuang and Huang taiji. But this is a harem of &ldquo;small transparent&rdquo;, after the death of Huang taiji but step by step to the fore, became the key figure in the early Qing dynasty national process.</p>
<p>The turning point in the fate of Xiaozhuang&rsquo;s life occurred on September 21, 1643 AD.</p>
<p>On that day, the Qing emperor Huang taiji died suddenly in Shengjing at the age of 52. Because of the suddenness of the incident, he did not leave a will before his death, the issue of successor to the throne, became the focus of discussion.</p>
<p>At that time, the most powerful successor to the throne are two people. One is Huang taiji&rsquo;s big brother, in charge of the Ministry of household affairs Su Prince Hauge, support him, mainly by Huang taiji direct command of the two yellow banners and blue banner generals, as well as Turg, Sony, Tu Lai, Ao Bai and a number of important courtiers. They believe that Hauge has made a lot of war, before Huang taiji was already Heshuo Baylor, after the emperor and promoted to Prince of Su, and his uncles on an equal footing, enough to prove that Huang taiji is willing to train him to succeed the throne.</p>
<p>The other is Huang taiji&rsquo;s brother, in charge of the Ministry of Rui Prince Dorgon, and Hauge compared to Dorgon, although not Huang taiji&rsquo;s children, but the generation is high, and more merit, two of his own brothers Azig and Doduo is also his hardcore supporters, has a white, set white two strong flag, many members of the clan also secretly support Dorgon ascension to the throne. These two groups of people for power, there was a sharp confrontation, once to the point of saber-rattling. At the time of the meeting, the two yellow banner ministers even entered the palace with weapons, claiming that if the eight banner masters choose someone other than Huang taiji&rsquo;s son as emperor, then they have to kill themselves on the spot and follow the late emperor. Although the words are so said, but from the standpoint of Dorgon and other people listening, that means too clear: you Dorgon dare to touch the throne, we two yellow flag people fight for their lives, but also to kill you!</p>
<p>At this time, dorgon and hoge outside the third force came forward, the final attribution of the throne played a decisive role in guiding. Their names, is Dai Shan and Jierhalang. Dai Shan the man, as we mentioned earlier, is Nurhachu&rsquo;s Great Baylor, he and his sons commanded the two red banners. In the eight banner king kilometers, Dai Shan&rsquo;s seniority is the oldest, the highest status, strength is actually the most powerful in each flag lord. But after years of wind and rain polished Dai Shan, at this moment has nothing to covet the throne, someone in the meeting proposed to embrace him as the emperor, also by Dai Shan directly refused, and in between Dorgon, Hauge two people, Dai Shan also did not have a clear statement of which side to support.</p>
<p>In contrast, the flag owner of the paneled blue banner Jierhalang, although usually obsequious, a good old-fashioned look, but at this time showed a calm and sophisticated side. He believes that, although Hauge is more qualified than Dorgon to succeed the throne, but in the strength of the latter is not as good, and must be elected from the two people, the other side is bound to fierce opposition, is not conducive to the unity of the eight banners. Therefore, Jierhalang proposed a compromise program, embracing the same Huang taiji son of Fulin succeeded to the throne, before Fulin grows up to rule, by him and Dorgon jointly assist the government. In this way, loyal to Huang taiji Jierhalang, to ensure that Hauge and other people will not be Dorgon group retaliation, and Dorgon&rsquo;s people do not have to worry about being liquidated.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this proposal was approved by all parties. Little Fulin&rsquo;s birth mother Zhuang Fei, was also able to and Huang taiji&rsquo;s Palace Queen of the two houses and honor, when the Empress Dowager. Later, with the Qing army, the sudden death of Dorgon, Kangxi reign and a series of events, the status of the Empress Dowager Xiao Zhuang also higher and higher, and finally got &ldquo;unified two dynasties of filial piety, extremely three generations of respect for relatives,&rdquo; the lofty status.</p>
