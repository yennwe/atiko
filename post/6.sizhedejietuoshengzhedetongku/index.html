  "articleBody": "Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over. But for those who are still alive behind them, this death is likely to be a lifetime of pain and suffering.\nBeing a forensic scientist is not just about facing corpses, it is also about facing the living. I said in the third “Salt Club” that\n“The doctor-patient relationship is more stable in forensic medicine”.\nIn fact, even pathologists who work mainly with cadavers also have to deal with the living - the families of the deceased.\nPersonally, I do not have any special feelings for the corpse itself, most of the time, I just see the corpse in front of me as a very pure object of work, and does not cause any special emotional fluctuations, even those who died tragically, unjustly, and after the death of the body was brutally destroyed, as the object of work, I can maintain a rational and calm mind to face.\nHowever, when confronting the families of the deceased at the crime scene, outside the autopsy room, and after the autopsy, I feel particularly difficult. Almost no family members can calmly accept the death of their loved ones, the scene of mourning will even make me feel that the air around me has become sticky, depressing to the point of breathlessness.\nOr in the year of internship, one day after dinner received a call from the forensic scientist on duty that day, I was quite devastated. I was thinking that a calm day is so beautiful, and then play for a while to wash up and go to bed. The idea itself is a huge Flag, every time will fall without fail.\nThe scene is located in a residential building in the community, from the environment can be seen is a medium to high-end neighborhood. When we arrived at the scene, a friend of the deceased’s husband opened the door for us, and after entering the living room, we saw a person lying in front of the bathroom door opposite the door. The husband of the deceased was sitting on the sofa in the living room, in a state of disorientation, his eyes dull, his mouth constantly chanting: “Why should I buy! Why did I buy that thing!”\n“I got a call from him at night and he said his wife had committed suicide.” The friend who opened the door for us said to us, “I told him to hurry up and call the police, I saw him like this when I arrived, and I haven’t asked what exactly is going on.\nIt was cruel, but it was important to find out from him what had happened.\nI walked over and sat next to him, took a deep breath, and asked him how he found out his wife was dead. The grieving husband sobbed and said to me, “Last night …… last night when we were both walking around the neighborhood …… she also assured me …… that she would not go to the extreme …… thing, both of us should go on …… well. Today …… morning I went out to work at 7 o’clock, before leaving …… her …… she also said to wait for me …… to return in the evening …… back for dinner! As a result, I …… I came back at 6 pm to see …… see the house lights on, I called out to her, but no …… no one … …promised, I changed my shoes after …… turning in and saw her …… her …… her hanging in the bathroom door, I rushed over to put …… put her …… hold …… down on …… call the emergency number, I am a doctor myself, I know …… there was no hope, but I couldn’t believe it, I couldn’t accept it. I just bought …… bought that equipment the day before yesterday, I was thinking about good exercise, good life, and she ended up killing herself with this!!! I should not have bought it! If I hadn’t bought it, it wouldn’t have been like this!\nAfter listening to his description, I feel very bad, before leaving home in the morning also agreed to dinner together in the evening, the evening back to meet not a hot dinner, but a cold body, who would have to grieve ah. His emotions also infected me, a time in the heart is also blocked.\nBut the heart is uncomfortable, but also to do the work. After understanding to him and his friends, the deceased was diagnosed with depression six months ago, and has been insisting on taking medication. Later to the hospital review, the doctor examined that the control is quite good. Probably because she felt significantly better, this wife decided to give herself off the medication until she finally died.\nAfter taking pictures of the scene to fix it, Forensic Scientist Sun and I went up to examine the body with good gloves. The deceased was lying on the ground in front of the bathroom, wearing a coat outside and a set of pajamas inside. The corpse stiffness has been formed throughout the body, the intensity is very high, the corpse spots are mainly concentrated in the legs, the back also has a little, fingers slightly hard pressure will fade. The whole face was dark red, and there was a silk scarf wrapped around the neck. After taking pictures carefully and removing the silk scarf, a wider constriction groove could be seen from below the chin to both sides in the direction behind the ears, which gradually disappeared behind the ears, and a “lifting hollow” appeared behind the neck. On the right side of the neck, there is a larger skin indentation relative to the rest of the neck where the silk scarf was knotted. The eyelids were turned over and there were dense hemorrhagic spots on the lid conjunctiva and some small hemorrhagic spots on the face.\nAs mentioned earlier, inferring the time of death is a very important part of pathological forensic work, and this time, because it is not long before death, it should be possible to set the time of death roughly to the level of “hours” based on the phenomenon of the body and the temperature of the body.\nAfter death, because the metabolism of the body has stopped, it can no longer continue to produce heat to maintain a normal body temperature of about 37 ℃. When the ambient temperature of the corpse is lower than the normal body temperature, the temperature of the corpse will slowly decrease until it is the same as the ambient temperature. This decrease in temperature has a certain regularity, and the way of measuring the corpse temperature is convenient and fast, and the accuracy of its results is more reliable, so the comparison of the corpse temperature and ambient temperature can be used to infer the time of death.\nThe measurement of postmortem temperature is different from the measurement of the body temperature of a living person often using the axillary temperature, the fastest cooling of the body is certainly the body surface, while the internal temperature of the body is usually used to measure the internal temperature of the body because it is less affected by the outside world. Most cases are measured rectal temperature, that is, the use of measuring anal temperature thermometer from the anus inserted into a section, and so the temperature stabilized for observation can be. Can also measure the liver temperature, the liver because closer to the body, the temperature accuracy of the rectal temperature will be higher, but the need to move in the body surface knife cut a small opening, not as convenient as measuring the anal temperature, so the vast majority of cases in practice is to use the measurement of rectal temperature to infer the time of death.\nI took out the thermometer from the box, first looked at the temperature in the room, after measuring the anal temperature and then looked at the temperature of the body than the house a little more than 8 ℃, usually in the spring and autumn season is generally the first 10 hours of death fell roughly 1 ℃ per hour, after the rate of decline will slow down, according to this temperature should be about 8 hours of death, but the stiffness seen in front of the corpse, corpse spots but not like only 8 hours Instead, it was more like close to 12 hours or so.\nAfter listening to my report, Dr. Sun said after some thought: “Because this is indoors, the temperature in the room is not very low, and she was still wearing clothes, the temperature may be slower to drop, can not absolutely rely on the temperature. Her husband said he had untied her for more than two hours, and you can see that there are only a little bit of new spots forming on the back, mainly on the legs, plus the intensity of the stiffness, so the time of death is about 11 hours.\nIn this way, the projection forward, it is now more than 7 pm, 11 hours ago, that is, about 8 am she has died. At that time, her husband had just left the house.\nNo more valuable information was found at the scene, and we explained to the husband that he would take his wife back for a simple superficial examination, not an autopsy, without destroying her body, to rule out the possibility that she had been killed by someone else. The husband was muddled, and I don’t know if he listened.\nBack to the autopsy room, the deceased on the autopsy table, the next step is to remove all the clothes of the deceased for examination. But Dr. Sun saw the husband of the deceased also followed in, Dr. Sun went over and explained to him again what we are going to do, and asked him to wait at the door first.\nI didn’t expect the husband of the deceased to say: “Don’t worry, I can understand your approach, I just don’t want her to lie alone in such a cold iron bed. I just don’t want to leave her alone in such a cold iron bed,” he said, as big tears rolled down his face, “Don’t do it, I’ll take her off. I said, while crying and holding my wife on the autopsy table, one by one, I took off my clothes.\nThat was one of the most uncomfortable post-mortem examinations I’ve ever done. In the past, when faced with abandoned children, brutally murdered girls, and innocent passersby, I had no strong psychological fluctuations, my work was just work. But this time, the emotions of the deceased’s family were like a big hand that grabbed my neck, making me feel like a lump in my throat.\nIn the end, nothing suspicious was found at the scene or on the body, and the conventional toxicology tests did not find anything toxic. The family of the deceased did not dispute her death and did not request an autopsy test. After issuing a cremation certificate, the matter is also considered closed.\nAlthough this was not a “case”, I was particularly impressed by the scene: not by the dead body, but by the emotions of the deceased’s husband, who gave me a tremendous shock, the heartfelt grief, sadness and remorse for a long time.\n“Once a person dies, a lot of human feelings come out.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Death for the dead themselves, it seems to mean a kind of relief, meaning that the things that happened before they were born are over. But for those who are still alive behind them, this death is likely to be a lifetime of pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Being a forensic scientist is not just about facing corpses, it is also about facing the living. I said in the third &ldquo;Salt Club&rdquo; that</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor-patient relationship is more stable in forensic medicine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In fact, even pathologists who work mainly with cadavers also have to deal with the living - the families of the deceased.</p>
<p>Personally, I do not have any special feelings for the corpse itself, most of the time, I just see the corpse in front of me as a very pure object of work, and does not cause any special emotional fluctuations, even those who died tragically, unjustly, and after the death of the body was brutally destroyed, as the object of work, I can maintain a rational and calm mind to face.</p>
<p>However, when confronting the families of the deceased at the crime scene, outside the autopsy room, and after the autopsy, I feel particularly difficult. Almost no family members can calmly accept the death of their loved ones, the scene of mourning will even make me feel that the air around me has become sticky, depressing to the point of breathlessness.</p>
<p>Or in the year of internship, one day after dinner received a call from the forensic scientist on duty that day, I was quite devastated. I was thinking that a calm day is so beautiful, and then play for a while to wash up and go to bed. The idea itself is a huge Flag, every time will fall without fail.</p>
<p>The scene is located in a residential building in the community, from the environment can be seen is a medium to high-end neighborhood. When we arrived at the scene, a friend of the deceased&rsquo;s husband opened the door for us, and after entering the living room, we saw a person lying in front of the bathroom door opposite the door. The husband of the deceased was sitting on the sofa in the living room, in a state of disorientation, his eyes dull, his mouth constantly chanting: &ldquo;Why should I buy! Why did I buy that thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a call from him at night and he said his wife had committed suicide.&rdquo; The friend who opened the door for us said to us, &ldquo;I told him to hurry up and call the police, I saw him like this when I arrived, and I haven&rsquo;t asked what exactly is going on.</p>
<p>It was cruel, but it was important to find out from him what had happened.</p>
<p>I walked over and sat next to him, took a deep breath, and asked him how he found out his wife was dead. The grieving husband sobbed and said to me, &ldquo;Last night &hellip;&hellip; last night when we were both walking around the neighborhood &hellip;&hellip; she also assured me &hellip;&hellip; that she would not go to the extreme &hellip;&hellip; thing, both of us should go on &hellip;&hellip; well. Today &hellip;&hellip; morning I went out to work at 7 o&rsquo;clock, before leaving &hellip;&hellip; her &hellip;&hellip; she also said to wait for me &hellip;&hellip; to return in the evening &hellip;&hellip; back for dinner! As a result, I &hellip;&hellip; I came back at 6 pm to see &hellip;&hellip; see the house lights on, I called out to her, but no &hellip;&hellip; no one &hellip; &hellip;promised, I changed my shoes after &hellip;&hellip; turning in and saw her &hellip;&hellip; her &hellip;&hellip; her hanging in the bathroom door, I rushed over to put &hellip;&hellip; put her &hellip;&hellip; hold &hellip;&hellip; down on &hellip;&hellip; call the emergency number, I am a doctor myself, I know &hellip;&hellip; there was no hope, but I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, I couldn&rsquo;t accept it. I just bought &hellip;&hellip; bought that equipment the day before yesterday, I was thinking about good exercise, good life, and she ended up killing herself with this!!! I should not have bought it! If I hadn&rsquo;t bought it, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been like this!</p>
<p>After listening to his description, I feel very bad, before leaving home in the morning also agreed to dinner together in the evening, the evening back to meet not a hot dinner, but a cold body, who would have to grieve ah. His emotions also infected me, a time in the heart is also blocked.</p>
<p>But the heart is uncomfortable, but also to do the work. After understanding to him and his friends, the deceased was diagnosed with depression six months ago, and has been insisting on taking medication. Later to the hospital review, the doctor examined that the control is quite good. Probably because she felt significantly better, this wife decided to give herself off the medication until she finally died.</p>
<p>After taking pictures of the scene to fix it, Forensic Scientist Sun and I went up to examine the body with good gloves. The deceased was lying on the ground in front of the bathroom, wearing a coat outside and a set of pajamas inside. The corpse stiffness has been formed throughout the body, the intensity is very high, the corpse spots are mainly concentrated in the legs, the back also has a little, fingers slightly hard pressure will fade. The whole face was dark red, and there was a silk scarf wrapped around the neck. After taking pictures carefully and removing the silk scarf, a wider constriction groove could be seen from below the chin to both sides in the direction behind the ears, which gradually disappeared behind the ears, and a &ldquo;lifting hollow&rdquo; appeared behind the neck. On the right side of the neck, there is a larger skin indentation relative to the rest of the neck where the silk scarf was knotted. The eyelids were turned over and there were dense hemorrhagic spots on the lid conjunctiva and some small hemorrhagic spots on the face.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, inferring the time of death is a very important part of pathological forensic work, and this time, because it is not long before death, it should be possible to set the time of death roughly to the level of &ldquo;hours&rdquo; based on the phenomenon of the body and the temperature of the body.</p>
<p>After death, because the metabolism of the body has stopped, it can no longer continue to produce heat to maintain a normal body temperature of about 37 ℃. When the ambient temperature of the corpse is lower than the normal body temperature, the temperature of the corpse will slowly decrease until it is the same as the ambient temperature. This decrease in temperature has a certain regularity, and the way of measuring the corpse temperature is convenient and fast, and the accuracy of its results is more reliable, so the comparison of the corpse temperature and ambient temperature can be used to infer the time of death.</p>
<p>The measurement of postmortem temperature is different from the measurement of the body temperature of a living person often using the axillary temperature, the fastest cooling of the body is certainly the body surface, while the internal temperature of the body is usually used to measure the internal temperature of the body because it is less affected by the outside world. Most cases are measured rectal temperature, that is, the use of measuring anal temperature thermometer from the anus inserted into a section, and so the temperature stabilized for observation can be. Can also measure the liver temperature, the liver because closer to the body, the temperature accuracy of the rectal temperature will be higher, but the need to move in the body surface knife cut a small opening, not as convenient as measuring the anal temperature, so the vast majority of cases in practice is to use the measurement of rectal temperature to infer the time of death.</p>
<p>I took out the thermometer from the box, first looked at the temperature in the room, after measuring the anal temperature and then looked at the temperature of the body than the house a little more than 8 ℃, usually in the spring and autumn season is generally the first 10 hours of death fell roughly 1 ℃ per hour, after the rate of decline will slow down, according to this temperature should be about 8 hours of death, but the stiffness seen in front of the corpse, corpse spots but not like only 8 hours Instead, it was more like close to 12 hours or so.</p>
<p>After listening to my report, Dr. Sun said after some thought: &ldquo;Because this is indoors, the temperature in the room is not very low, and she was still wearing clothes, the temperature may be slower to drop, can not absolutely rely on the temperature. Her husband said he had untied her for more than two hours, and you can see that there are only a little bit of new spots forming on the back, mainly on the legs, plus the intensity of the stiffness, so the time of death is about 11 hours.</p>
<p>In this way, the projection forward, it is now more than 7 pm, 11 hours ago, that is, about 8 am she has died. At that time, her husband had just left the house.</p>
<p>No more valuable information was found at the scene, and we explained to the husband that he would take his wife back for a simple superficial examination, not an autopsy, without destroying her body, to rule out the possibility that she had been killed by someone else. The husband was muddled, and I don&rsquo;t know if he listened.</p>
<p>Back to the autopsy room, the deceased on the autopsy table, the next step is to remove all the clothes of the deceased for examination. But Dr. Sun saw the husband of the deceased also followed in, Dr. Sun went over and explained to him again what we are going to do, and asked him to wait at the door first.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect the husband of the deceased to say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I can understand your approach, I just don&rsquo;t want her to lie alone in such a cold iron bed. I just don&rsquo;t want to leave her alone in such a cold iron bed,&rdquo; he said, as big tears rolled down his face, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;ll take her off. I said, while crying and holding my wife on the autopsy table, one by one, I took off my clothes.</p>
<p>That was one of the most uncomfortable post-mortem examinations I&rsquo;ve ever done. In the past, when faced with abandoned children, brutally murdered girls, and innocent passersby, I had no strong psychological fluctuations, my work was just work. But this time, the emotions of the deceased&rsquo;s family were like a big hand that grabbed my neck, making me feel like a lump in my throat.</p>
<p>In the end, nothing suspicious was found at the scene or on the body, and the conventional toxicology tests did not find anything toxic. The family of the deceased did not dispute her death and did not request an autopsy test. After issuing a cremation certificate, the matter is also considered closed.</p>
<p>Although this was not a &ldquo;case&rdquo;, I was particularly impressed by the scene: not by the dead body, but by the emotions of the deceased&rsquo;s husband, who gave me a tremendous shock, the heartfelt grief, sadness and remorse for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once a person dies, a lot of human feelings come out.</p>
