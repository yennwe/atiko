  "articleBody": "“Murderer, Me!” : He was extremely twisted and played a provocative game with the police with his bizarre and sadistic methods of killing!\nDo you know how scary it is to be friends with a man with a twisted mind?\nHe has a theory of his own, and whether it’s right or wrong, it’s irrefutable! If you look at you, he will change the way to be good to you, even he can not use the things to give you. But once you anger him, the world will immediately be a living person less, more a corpse abused! What degree of abuse? It can be said that the scene, after anyone look at it, it will be like a nightmare, along with you for life ……\nSay a real case that happened many years ago. I will try my best to restore it as a personal witness, so that everyone can see what this murderer, whom we call the most twisted in the country, is really like. And what was it like to be friends with him?\n(The following part of the scene may cause discomfort, resistance to stress is not strong, it is recommended to stop!)\nJune 28, 1993.\nIt was an early morning when everyone was asleep, and we were all standing under the flagpole of a wheat farm called Baoshan County for a long time.\nOriginally, this should have been a red flag on it, but at this time, there was only a headless male corpse.\nAn iron hook, hard into the chest of the corpse, hanging it on the flagpole, strong wind blowing, it is still with the wind, a swaying.\nThe corpse was dressed in an earthy green uniform, but this does not necessarily mean that the deceased was a soldier. In those days, in small places like Baoshan County, wearing a military uniform was still a trend.\nWaiting for a closer look, the uniform was very flat. It gave the impression that it was either new or had been carefully washed or even ironed.\nThe top of the uniform was seeped through with a small amount of blood, and a small pool of blood was also distributed directly below the body. As for the scene, especially around the flagpole, there were various messy footprints and blood spots distributed.\nThe most impressive thing was that someone had written a line in chalk on the flagpole: “Murderer, me!\nTo be honest, my brain was in a mess. For one reason, the scene was brutal. It was clear that the killer cut off the head and immediately hung the headless body.\nWith blood, hanging alive!\nIt is estimated that the “flag”, the body is not yet dead, it is likely that the hands and feet will twitch a little.\nIn addition, I always feel that something is not right.\nFirst of all, I have seen cases of abuse and murder, the most ruthless scene, the victim was lynched, the kind of death by a thousand cuts. Or cook the whole body, and then on the face and body graffiti.\nBut the corpse in front of me, in the clothing even neatly.\nIf it is a sadistic murder, why let the dead so decent?\nSecondly, what does the killer mean by leaving this message? Is it a provocation?\nHalf an hour later, someone came over with a police dog. This is also a feature of the nineties to handle cases, there was no powerful skynet and DNA technology, in the field scene investigation, often have to use the dog nose.\nThe police dog searched the neighborhood for quite some time and eventually found a new clue from a wheat stack thirty meters away from the flagpole. A trampled cassette tape.\nThe tape had bloody fingerprints on it, indicating that the killer had discarded it.\nAnother horrible thought came to me as a result: the killer was killing people while listening to a song. But whose song? Little Tiger or Jacky Cheung?\nIntroduce myself. Everyone calls me Lao Ge, in the nineties engaged in a special occupation - special case gray eyes and ears, which is also the predecessor of the later 321 (criminal special intelligence).\nAs anyone who has been there knows, there were more big and important cases in those days, and the police force was seriously inadequate, and prisoners like me, who were slightly skilled, were “recruited” and became a forceful auxiliary force.\nAfter I returned from the scene, together with a few eyes and ears, attended the police case analysis meeting.\nOf course, we people can only sit in the last row of chairs. My partner beard, a former prison oil (prison head prison bully), he was not listening at all. I on the contrary, very carefully taking notes.\nBeard secretly spit with me: “This gang of big brothers (public security) pure pants fart, the murder occurred, go early to arrest people! What meeting? To me is the murderer, take advantage of this period, must have escaped ten miles away again.”\nI do not agree. Really let him say so, it is called brutality! And I then answered the question, “Do you think the killer will escape?”\nSeeing my serious face, he also put away his joking heart.\n“Escape? With such a disgusting killing method, this person is extremely strong psychologically! Maybe now are home to sleep!” This is his original words.\nNext, the police decided to take a two-pronged approach.\nOne is to check the source of the corpse; the second is to rank the suspect, the murder scene as the center, in a five-mile radius, do a large-scale visit.\nThe beard and I were assigned the task, originally in a place called the White Village action, and folks to inquire and inquire.\nBut it only lasted half a day, the upper line (scout) Ma Sanshui paged me: urgent, return quickly!\nI knew there must be another new clue. But I did not expect that it could be so bizarre.\nForgive me for the wording, but so described, not exaggerated at all.\nThe forensic autopsy found that the deceased once ate a very rich dinner, especially with beef.\nAt that time, Baoshan County is very backward, we still receive meat stamps, and even many people in order to eat more oil, often buy fat back to boil oil.\nSo the beard and I were surprised to hear the word beef.\n“Brother Shui, according to you, the deceased is still a money man ha!” Beard first to express his views.\nMa Sanshui sunken face, then broke the news of another incident.\nWhen the forensic pathologist took off the clothes of the deceased, actually smelled his body stinks.\n“Does the corpse stink?” This time I asked first.\nMa Sanshui shook his head: “More like vomiting in the smell of sweat! Especially the crotch there, also particularly smoky, I guess it has not been a long time to shower.”\nI wondered even more. Can afford to eat beef, but personal hygiene is so poor?\nFinally Ma Sanshui found a Walkman, put a cassette tape into it.\nIt was actually the one damaged at the scene, which was now repaired.\nI have a feeling of eager anticipation, wondering what in the end will hear?\nI guessed for a while before that it would be some kind of song, but when I listened for a short while, I was surprised and almost grew my mouth.\nThis seems to be a scene of some kind, someone crying, someone laughing, and someone humming and yapping, saying that he is sending gong. And hair gong this person also stressed several times that his skills are very powerful, listen to the tape can also, the same his gong can also heal the listener.\n“Qi, qigong?” When Ma Sanshui pressed the pause button, the beard asked speculatively.\nMa Sanshui nodded: “This is a tape of a qigong master healing. This person’s name is Zhang Jianjun, catching up with the people of Baoshan County! And the police just investigated, he was once a butcher before learning qigong!”\n“Quite a bully! Butcher to learn qigong, and also learned!” Hu Zi spat.\nAnd I understood what Ma Sanshui meant. This Zhang Jianjun, has been listed as an important suspect. Think about it, he worked as a butcher, and there were tapes about him at the crime scene.\nIt’s hard to believe that this is a qigong master murder case? But what was the motive? With wacky techniques, research how to kill people to cure diseases?\nMa Sanshui said, which took us both to find Zhang Jianjun.\nOf course, the occasion of departure, he deliberately pointed down the head: “You guys get ready, this Zhang Jianjun, I heard here is not ordinary!”\n“Twisted? Twisted?” Beard asked after.\nMa Sanshui an intriguing expression, did not answer again.\nZhang Jianjun gave me the first impression, simply too recognizable.\nHe had a face of flesh, but had to comb a big back hair, waxed the kind of hair. In addition to the occasion of the door, I found that he was wearing an earthy green military uniform, no pleats on it.\nMa Sanshui bright public security documents, but did not wait to say anything, Zhang Jianjun casually waved a hand, let us in.\nIt looked like coaxing a chicken or herding a duck.\n“Damn it!” Hu Zi almost fumed on the spot, but I stabbed him.\nIn fact, I was also uncomfortable in my heart, but the case was in front of me. And I did not forget to secretly remind the beard, “forget how the officer asked us?”\n“Smile and have quality. I know!” Beard impatiently interrupted, but also deliberately to me a grin.\nIt was almost like crying, especially the two big yellow teeth.\nI told him not to smile, just do not mess up later.\nSoon we sat in the living room of Zhang Jianjun’s house, I observed, his family is very rich, probably related to his current occupation.\nIn the nineties, it was a very big deal to know qigong, and there was a time when qigong fever was popular. How hot was it? Countless people competed to learn it, including even celebrities, officials, and foreign dignitaries.\nSo with this, I felt a little emotion in my heart.\nThis Zhang Jianjun, however, did not give us a chance to speak, and no one could interrupt. He was simply talking about qigong-related matters.\nFirst, the mystery of qigong, and his master is a famous who, after he learned, how to use qigong to universalize all beings, to the people’s welfare to cure the disease.\nI looked at the watch, a full twenty minutes. Only after that Ma Sanshui found the opportunity to ask about the case.\n“What’s the matter? I, a master respected by everyone, have become a suspect?” He shouted in exasperation.\n“It’s not that, I hope you can assist the police!” Ma Sanshui tried to explain.\n“Don’t give me that! Call my lawyer if you need anything!” He finished and grabbed the phone.\nI realized that the only thing we had done on this visit was to listen to Zhang Jianjun’s blind bragging.\nWhen we got out, the beard suggested that there was nothing to talk about with this kind of goods, let him go back alone again and have a good talk with the other side.\nBut Ma Sanshui stopped the beard, he gave us both instructions: stakeout!\nI understand the difficulty of Ma Sanshui, to be honest, this kind of small famous qigong master, really do not cooperate, the police also really headache.\nAnd next, we both moved to the opposite side of Zhang Jianjun’s house.\nThis is a dilapidated private house. At that time, it was still a public housing system, this residence because it was too dilapidated, the original residents moved out, and it was empty. So it’s convenient for me and the beard.\nTo reveal in advance, it is this stalking, the beard and I completely confused.\nBecause one night, this “Zhang Jianjun”, at the same time, but in a different place appeared. A bizarre case of abuse and murder, also appeared ……\nJune 30, 1993\nThe first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you’re doing. The reason is that the manpower is too tight, this stakeout, it has been me and beard.\nThe two of us discussed, simply six hours a round of posts.\nWho is on duty, sitting in front of the window, looking across through binoculars.\nThe beard is an old man, so he used to pass the time in very few ways, in addition to sucking the root of the turret, is to look at the sky.\nI’m different, every time stalking, choose to look at the newspaper.\nIn fact, from reading the newspaper, I know how much of a headache the police have now.\nVarious local dailies and evening newspapers, as well as newspapers from neighboring cities, have published body claim notices on them.\nThe problem is, this is a headless corpse, without knowing exactly what the body looks like, and someone dares to take a chance on it?\nI have therefore also thought about the question: where is the head in the end?\nWe, the people, and the dogs, searched the murder scene several times over and over again, but never found it.\nIn the end, the killer has a quirk? Or is it that the head itself has something to say?\nIn this way, I stayed up until midnight.\nAt night, Baoshan County is very quiet, there are no street lights, take a look, where there is a darkness.\nOriginally, I was breathing heavily and holding on to sleep. But all of a sudden, there was movement across the courtyard door.\nI shook my head, let myself wake up some, also immediately close binoculars.\nIt was Zhang Jianjun, who, like a thief, looked left and right immediately after opening the door, and he was holding a long object, wrapped in newspaper.\n“What’s he up to?” A question mark popped up in my head.\nDon’t say he went to see anyone at night with qigong, fools will believe it!\nJust wait to confirm that no one is around, Zhang Jianjun left the house. But looking at his walking posture, I was even more amazed.\nHow shivering, which made me think of cerebral thrombosis patients.\nAnd his final destination was a garbage can.\nHe threw that stuff in with a brain and walked home with another cerebral thrombosis-like stride.\n“Beard, hey!” I called to him immediately.\nHe was snoring and woke up, still a little confused from the cold.\n“Zhang Jianjun just left the house!” I reminded him.\nBeard yawned: “Qigong master is also a man, I understand, can not stand loneliness, looking for a woman, right?”\nI said he has a problem with this thinking, what is this thinking ah?\nI said two more simple words.\nThe beard froze for a moment, and then immediately put on his shoes.\nThe two of us took advantage of the night and sneaked to the garbage can.\nI held up a flashlight, the beard is not too dirty, reach out in the inside of the search.\nSoon there was a discovery. The beard took the thing out and pulled the top newspaper.\nThis moment, we both silent.\nThis is a boning knife, very common in the meat stall. And at this time this knife, blood stains.\nIt was all dried blood.\n“The evidence is overwhelming! I’ll see how that bragging goods still pretend!” Beard said, and quickly wrapped the knife again.\nHis intention, a direct kick down and break into the door.\nBut when we came to the courtyard door, we both heard that there was movement in the courtyard, as if someone was shoveling dirt.\nBeard gestured the shape of a human head. This is a silent reminder to me.\nAnd Zhang Jianjun’s courtyard wall is not high, it is difficult for me and the beard.\nWe both went around, picked the right place, and gently climbed up.\nImagine, the moon is high and windy night, the two of us lying on the wall, looking down at the scene: Zhang Jianjun clip flashlight, is digging a pit with a shovel, and in the middle of the pit, really placed a bloody human head.\nThis human head is also a bit of signs of corruption, a group of flies, hovering above it buzzing.\nZhang Jianjun is also definitely too focused, has not noticed the two of us.\nBut the beard really can’t help it, suddenly came to a voice. Also do not say, with a shocking thunder about the same power!\n“Tally! Master! What are you doing?”\nZhang Jianjun’s feet like a spring, whoosh jumped up, and then before he could look up, he poofed again, lying on the ground.\nBefore the police rushed over, Zhang Jianjun smoked several times. I suspect it was scared by the beard this voice.\nThe pumping that is called a powerful, spitting white foam, hands are with the chicken claws have a fight.\nI was also worried, how to do? The master must not be drawn to death!\nBut the beard has a trick, according to him, when he was in prison, it is not uncommon to see this kind of guy committing smoking disease.\nI thought he knew about medicine, who knew that the next, he aimed at Zhang Jianjun’s face, left and right snapped two sounds.\nI do not know what principle, but I have to say, people are better ……\nAfter coming to the interrogation room, Zhang Jianjun a little master of the frame are no longer, simply with the bamboo beans, and we said that he would not what qigong, his master will not, and his master was once a street art, will be a little biased only.\nI pinched the watch to see, he confessed so twenty minutes. But the problem also came.\nInterrogation police patted the table: “Comrade, the deceitful thing to put on the back burner, you first explain the experience of killing!”\nZhang Jianjun seems to have thought of something, gah, and to faint.\nSee this, I guess his image of this qigong master, is completely pulled to!\nAnd the next, even I thought, the case has been solved, who knows where to where this?\nZhang Jianjun confessed: he is not a murderer, just heard movement in the yard at night, he thought into the thieves, but went out to see, there is a nook on the ground of the soil is very new, like being buried again after digging. And this also put a newspaper wrapped things, open a look, is a bloody knife.\nHe was so frightened that his first thought was to throw the thing away. When he came back, he wondered again, what was odd in that piece of soil, the result of digging out a look ……\nOriginally his words, we do not believe.\nThink about it, in the middle of the night, the killer ate enough to go to his house to destroy evidence? The middle of nowhere is not much stronger than his home?\nBut Zhang Jianjun finally pointed to the light, and kneeled down to swear, even the ancestors are moved out, anyway, all kinds of assurance that he did not kill.\nWhat’s even more bizarre is that two hours later, the police received a report that a body was found in the smoke bed of Bai Village, and the time of death was the latter part of last night, and the murderer was Zhang Jianjun!\nThe reason why we can be so sure of the murderer is that at the crime scene, the murderer left a handwriting: “Murderer, me! Zhang Jianjun!”\nThe beard and I had been to the White Village before, so we knew a little about the situation here.\nThe villagers all grow tobacco, and the tobacco bed has become a very typical building here. To put it bluntly, it is a kind of simple house built with adobe.\nWhen we arrived at the scene with Ma Sanshui, a cordon was drawn here.\nForgive me for being mentally prepared, but the moment I went in, my heart still stuttered.\nThe same killing method. A headless male corpse was hung by an iron hook, hanging from a beam inside the house, the upper half of his uniform and the floor, were distributed with dried blood.\nAnd on a piece of wall in the smoke bed, simply too striking, were written two lines. The first line: “Murderer, me! Zhang Jianjun!”\nThe second line: “No, beast!”\nBeard and I exploded then. Beard cursed and grinned.\nIf it were normal, Ma Sanshui would have criticized the beard and told him to pay attention to quality. But at this time, he just sullen face.\nIn fact, which I do not understand, the beard’s scolding, but also scolded the heart of everyone!\nThis murderer, simply arrogant can!\nOf course, I in order to bite the right thing, deliberately asked the forensic pathologist: “the time of death to determine the second half of last night?”\nHe just pointed to the survey box.\nHere sat a thermometer with some sticky, yellowish stuff stuck to it.\nI guess he had just measured the anal temperature of the body.\n“So, Zhang Jianjun’s suspicion is ruled out?” I thought silently.\nOr unless Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, knows some kind of diversion, which can appear in different places at the same time.\nThe police also brought in police dogs and searched extensively with the smoke bed as the center.\nWe all thought that the tape would be found again, but the result was nothing.\nOn the contrary, the forensic pathologist found a new bizarre.\nThe dead man’s hand was clutching a screw.\nAt that time, in order to take it off, the forensic pathologist almost broke the corpse’s fingertips.\nIt looks ordinary, in hardware stores or construction sites can be found everywhere, or walking in the street, get a bad pick up.\nMa Sanshui stressed: this is an important clue, it is likely that the deceased to tell us something.\nThe problem is that the police have been studying for a long time, but in the end there is no accurate statement.\nSome people believe that the deceased intended to say that the killer is a construction worker; others believe that this is instead a false clue deliberately left by the killer.\nAnd then combined with the common and suspicious points of these two cases: the deceased had eaten a sumptuous dinner before death, wearing a very neat military uniform, the body itself is very smelly …… so these things.\nThe case was at once at an impasse.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>&ldquo;Murderer, Me!&rdquo; : He was extremely twisted and played a provocative game with the police with his bizarre and sadistic methods of killing!</p>
<p>Do you know how scary it is to be friends with a man with a twisted mind?</p>
<p>He has a theory of his own, and whether it&rsquo;s right or wrong, it&rsquo;s irrefutable! If you look at you, he will change the way to be good to you, even he can not use the things to give you. But once you anger him, the world will immediately be a living person less, more a corpse abused!
What degree of abuse? It can be said that the scene, after anyone look at it, it will be like a nightmare, along with you for life &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Say a real case that happened many years ago. I will try my best to restore it as a personal witness, so that everyone can see what this murderer, whom we call the most twisted in the country, is really like. And what was it like to be friends with him?</p>
<p>(The following part of the scene may cause discomfort, resistance to stress is not strong, it is recommended to stop!)</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>June 28, 1993.</p>
<p>It was an early morning when everyone was asleep, and we were all standing under the flagpole of a wheat farm called Baoshan County for a long time.</p>
<p>Originally, this should have been a red flag on it, but at this time, there was only a headless male corpse.</p>
<p>An iron hook, hard into the chest of the corpse, hanging it on the flagpole, strong wind blowing, it is still with the wind, a swaying.</p>
<p>The corpse was dressed in an earthy green uniform, but this does not necessarily mean that the deceased was a soldier. In those days, in small places like Baoshan County, wearing a military uniform was still a trend.</p>
<p>Waiting for a closer look, the uniform was very flat. It gave the impression that it was either new or had been carefully washed or even ironed.</p>
<p>The top of the uniform was seeped through with a small amount of blood, and a small pool of blood was also distributed directly below the body. As for the scene, especially around the flagpole, there were various messy footprints and blood spots distributed.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing was that someone had written a line in chalk on the flagpole: &ldquo;Murderer, me!</p>
<p>To be honest, my brain was in a mess. For one reason, the scene was brutal. It was clear that the killer cut off the head and immediately hung the headless body.</p>
<p>With blood, hanging alive!</p>
<p>It is estimated that the &ldquo;flag&rdquo;, the body is not yet dead, it is likely that the hands and feet will twitch a little.</p>
<p>In addition, I always feel that something is not right.</p>
<p>First of all, I have seen cases of abuse and murder, the most ruthless scene, the victim was lynched, the kind of death by a thousand cuts. Or cook the whole body, and then on the face and body graffiti.</p>
<p>But the corpse in front of me, in the clothing even neatly.</p>
<p>If it is a sadistic murder, why let the dead so decent?</p>
<p>Secondly, what does the killer mean by leaving this message? Is it a provocation?</p>
<p>Half an hour later, someone came over with a police dog. This is also a feature of the nineties to handle cases, there was no powerful skynet and DNA technology, in the field scene investigation, often have to use the dog nose.</p>
<p>The police dog searched the neighborhood for quite some time and eventually found a new clue from a wheat stack thirty meters away from the flagpole. A trampled cassette tape.</p>
<p>The tape had bloody fingerprints on it, indicating that the killer had discarded it.</p>
<p>Another horrible thought came to me as a result: the killer was killing people while listening to a song. But whose song? Little Tiger or Jacky Cheung?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Introduce myself. Everyone calls me Lao Ge, in the nineties engaged in a special occupation - special case gray eyes and ears, which is also the predecessor of the later 321 (criminal special intelligence).</p>
<p>As anyone who has been there knows, there were more big and important cases in those days, and the police force was seriously inadequate, and prisoners like me, who were slightly skilled, were &ldquo;recruited&rdquo; and became a forceful auxiliary force.</p>
<p>After I returned from the scene, together with a few eyes and ears, attended the police case analysis meeting.</p>
<p>Of course, we people can only sit in the last row of chairs. My partner beard, a former prison oil (prison head prison bully), he was not listening at all. I on the contrary, very carefully taking notes.</p>
<p>Beard secretly spit with me: &ldquo;This gang of big brothers (public security) pure pants fart, the murder occurred, go early to arrest people! What meeting? To me is the murderer, take advantage of this period, must have escaped ten miles away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not agree. Really let him say so, it is called brutality! And I then answered the question, &ldquo;Do you think the killer will escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing my serious face, he also put away his joking heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escape? With such a disgusting killing method, this person is extremely strong psychologically! Maybe now are home to sleep!&rdquo; This is his original words.</p>
<p>Next, the police decided to take a two-pronged approach.</p>
<p>One is to check the source of the corpse; the second is to rank the suspect, the murder scene as the center, in a five-mile radius, do a large-scale visit.</p>
<p>The beard and I were assigned the task, originally in a place called the White Village action, and folks to inquire and inquire.</p>
<p>But it only lasted half a day, the upper line (scout) Ma Sanshui paged me: urgent, return quickly!</p>
<p>I knew there must be another new clue. But I did not expect that it could be so bizarre.</p>
<p>Forgive me for the wording, but so described, not exaggerated at all.</p>
<p>The forensic autopsy found that the deceased once ate a very rich dinner, especially with beef.</p>
<p>At that time, Baoshan County is very backward, we still receive meat stamps, and even many people in order to eat more oil, often buy fat back to boil oil.</p>
<p>So the beard and I were surprised to hear the word beef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Shui, according to you, the deceased is still a money man ha!&rdquo; Beard first to express his views.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui sunken face, then broke the news of another incident.</p>
<p>When the forensic pathologist took off the clothes of the deceased, actually smelled his body stinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the corpse stink?&rdquo; This time I asked first.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui shook his head: &ldquo;More like vomiting in the smell of sweat! Especially the crotch there, also particularly smoky, I guess it has not been a long time to shower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered even more. Can afford to eat beef, but personal hygiene is so poor?</p>
<p>Finally Ma Sanshui found a Walkman, put a cassette tape into it.</p>
<p>It was actually the one damaged at the scene, which was now repaired.</p>
<p>I have a feeling of eager anticipation, wondering what in the end will hear?</p>
<p>I guessed for a while before that it would be some kind of song, but when I listened for a short while, I was surprised and almost grew my mouth.</p>
<p>This seems to be a scene of some kind, someone crying, someone laughing, and someone humming and yapping, saying that he is sending gong. And hair gong this person also stressed several times that his skills are very powerful, listen to the tape can also, the same his gong can also heal the listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Qi, qigong?&rdquo; When Ma Sanshui pressed the pause button, the beard asked speculatively.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui nodded: &ldquo;This is a tape of a qigong master healing. This person&rsquo;s name is Zhang Jianjun, catching up with the people of Baoshan County! And the police just investigated, he was once a butcher before learning qigong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a bully! Butcher to learn qigong, and also learned!&rdquo; Hu Zi spat.</p>
<p>And I understood what Ma Sanshui meant. This Zhang Jianjun, has been listed as an important suspect. Think about it, he worked as a butcher, and there were tapes about him at the crime scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that this is a qigong master murder case? But what was the motive? With wacky techniques, research how to kill people to cure diseases?</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui said, which took us both to find Zhang Jianjun.</p>
<p>Of course, the occasion of departure, he deliberately pointed down the head: &ldquo;You guys get ready, this Zhang Jianjun, I heard here is not ordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twisted? Twisted?&rdquo; Beard asked after.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui an intriguing expression, did not answer again.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Jianjun gave me the first impression, simply too recognizable.</p>
<p>He had a face of flesh, but had to comb a big back hair, waxed the kind of hair. In addition to the occasion of the door, I found that he was wearing an earthy green military uniform, no pleats on it.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui bright public security documents, but did not wait to say anything, Zhang Jianjun casually waved a hand, let us in.</p>
<p>It looked like coaxing a chicken or herding a duck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo; Hu Zi almost fumed on the spot, but I stabbed him.</p>
<p>In fact, I was also uncomfortable in my heart, but the case was in front of me. And I did not forget to secretly remind the beard, &ldquo;forget how the officer asked us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smile and have quality. I know!&rdquo; Beard impatiently interrupted, but also deliberately to me a grin.</p>
<p>It was almost like crying, especially the two big yellow teeth.</p>
<p>I told him not to smile, just do not mess up later.</p>
<p>Soon we sat in the living room of Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s house, I observed, his family is very rich, probably related to his current occupation.</p>
<p>In the nineties, it was a very big deal to know qigong, and there was a time when qigong fever was popular. How hot was it? Countless people competed to learn it, including even celebrities, officials, and foreign dignitaries.</p>
<p>So with this, I felt a little emotion in my heart.</p>
<p>This Zhang Jianjun, however, did not give us a chance to speak, and no one could interrupt. He was simply talking about qigong-related matters.</p>
<p>First, the mystery of qigong, and his master is a famous who, after he learned, how to use qigong to universalize all beings, to the people&rsquo;s welfare to cure the disease.</p>
<p>I looked at the watch, a full twenty minutes. Only after that Ma Sanshui found the opportunity to ask about the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? I, a master respected by everyone, have become a suspect?&rdquo; He shouted in exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, I hope you can assist the police!&rdquo; Ma Sanshui tried to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that! Call my lawyer if you need anything!&rdquo; He finished and grabbed the phone.</p>
<p>I realized that the only thing we had done on this visit was to listen to Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s blind bragging.</p>
<p>When we got out, the beard suggested that there was nothing to talk about with this kind of goods, let him go back alone again and have a good talk with the other side.</p>
<p>But Ma Sanshui stopped the beard, he gave us both instructions: stakeout!</p>
<p>I understand the difficulty of Ma Sanshui, to be honest, this kind of small famous qigong master, really do not cooperate, the police also really headache.</p>
<p>And next, we both moved to the opposite side of Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>This is a dilapidated private house. At that time, it was still a public housing system, this residence because it was too dilapidated, the original residents moved out, and it was empty. So it&rsquo;s convenient for me and the beard.</p>
<p>To reveal in advance, it is this stalking, the beard and I completely confused.</p>
<p>Because one night, this &ldquo;Zhang Jianjun&rdquo;, at the same time, but in a different place appeared. A bizarre case of abuse and murder, also appeared &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>June 30, 1993</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you&rsquo;re doing. The reason is that the manpower is too tight, this stakeout, it has been me and beard.</p>
<p>The two of us discussed, simply six hours a round of posts.</p>
<p>Who is on duty, sitting in front of the window, looking across through binoculars.</p>
<p>The beard is an old man, so he used to pass the time in very few ways, in addition to sucking the root of the turret, is to look at the sky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m different, every time stalking, choose to look at the newspaper.</p>
<p>In fact, from reading the newspaper, I know how much of a headache the police have now.</p>
<p>Various local dailies and evening newspapers, as well as newspapers from neighboring cities, have published body claim notices on them.</p>
<p>The problem is, this is a headless corpse, without knowing exactly what the body looks like, and someone dares to take a chance on it?</p>
<p>I have therefore also thought about the question: where is the head in the end?</p>
<p>We, the people, and the dogs, searched the murder scene several times over and over again, but never found it.</p>
<p>In the end, the killer has a quirk? Or is it that the head itself has something to say?</p>
<p>In this way, I stayed up until midnight.</p>
<p>At night, Baoshan County is very quiet, there are no street lights, take a look, where there is a darkness.</p>
<p>Originally, I was breathing heavily and holding on to sleep. But all of a sudden, there was movement across the courtyard door.</p>
<p>I shook my head, let myself wake up some, also immediately close binoculars.</p>
<p>It was Zhang Jianjun, who, like a thief, looked left and right immediately after opening the door, and he was holding a long object, wrapped in newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he up to?&rdquo; A question mark popped up in my head.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say he went to see anyone at night with qigong, fools will believe it!</p>
<p>Just wait to confirm that no one is around, Zhang Jianjun left the house. But looking at his walking posture, I was even more amazed.</p>
<p>How shivering, which made me think of cerebral thrombosis patients.</p>
<p>And his final destination was a garbage can.</p>
<p>He threw that stuff in with a brain and walked home with another cerebral thrombosis-like stride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beard, hey!&rdquo; I called to him immediately.</p>
<p>He was snoring and woke up, still a little confused from the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Jianjun just left the house!&rdquo; I reminded him.</p>
<p>Beard yawned: &ldquo;Qigong master is also a man, I understand, can not stand loneliness, looking for a woman, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said he has a problem with this thinking, what is this thinking ah?</p>
<p>I said two more simple words.</p>
<p>The beard froze for a moment, and then immediately put on his shoes.</p>
<p>The two of us took advantage of the night and sneaked to the garbage can.</p>
<p>I held up a flashlight, the beard is not too dirty, reach out in the inside of the search.</p>
<p>Soon there was a discovery. The beard took the thing out and pulled the top newspaper.</p>
<p>This moment, we both silent.</p>
<p>This is a boning knife, very common in the meat stall. And at this time this knife, blood stains.</p>
<p>It was all dried blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evidence is overwhelming! I&rsquo;ll see how that bragging goods still pretend!&rdquo; Beard said, and quickly wrapped the knife again.</p>
<p>His intention, a direct kick down and break into the door.</p>
<p>But when we came to the courtyard door, we both heard that there was movement in the courtyard, as if someone was shoveling dirt.</p>
<p>Beard gestured the shape of a human head. This is a silent reminder to me.</p>
<p>And Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s courtyard wall is not high, it is difficult for me and the beard.</p>
<p>We both went around, picked the right place, and gently climbed up.</p>
<p>Imagine, the moon is high and windy night, the two of us lying on the wall, looking down at the scene: Zhang Jianjun clip flashlight, is digging a pit with a shovel, and in the middle of the pit, really placed a bloody human head.</p>
<p>This human head is also a bit of signs of corruption, a group of flies, hovering above it buzzing.</p>
<p>Zhang Jianjun is also definitely too focused, has not noticed the two of us.</p>
<p>But the beard really can&rsquo;t help it, suddenly came to a voice. Also do not say, with a shocking thunder about the same power!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tally! Master! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s feet like a spring, whoosh jumped up, and then before he could look up, he poofed again, lying on the ground.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Before the police rushed over, Zhang Jianjun smoked several times. I suspect it was scared by the beard this voice.</p>
<p>The pumping that is called a powerful, spitting white foam, hands are with the chicken claws have a fight.</p>
<p>I was also worried, how to do? The master must not be drawn to death!</p>
<p>But the beard has a trick, according to him, when he was in prison, it is not uncommon to see this kind of guy committing smoking disease.</p>
<p>I thought he knew about medicine, who knew that the next, he aimed at Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s face, left and right snapped two sounds.</p>
<p>I do not know what principle, but I have to say, people are better &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>After coming to the interrogation room, Zhang Jianjun a little master of the frame are no longer, simply with the bamboo beans, and we said that he would not what qigong, his master will not, and his master was once a street art, will be a little biased only.</p>
<p>I pinched the watch to see, he confessed so twenty minutes. But the problem also came.</p>
<p>Interrogation police patted the table: &ldquo;Comrade, the deceitful thing to put on the back burner, you first explain the experience of killing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhang Jianjun seems to have thought of something, gah, and to faint.</p>
<p>See this, I guess his image of this qigong master, is completely pulled to!</p>
<p>And the next, even I thought, the case has been solved, who knows where to where this?</p>
<p>Zhang Jianjun confessed: he is not a murderer, just heard movement in the yard at night, he thought into the thieves, but went out to see, there is a nook on the ground of the soil is very new, like being buried again after digging. And this also put a newspaper wrapped things, open a look, is a bloody knife.</p>
<p>He was so frightened that his first thought was to throw the thing away. When he came back, he wondered again, what was odd in that piece of soil, the result of digging out a look &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Originally his words, we do not believe.</p>
<p>Think about it, in the middle of the night, the killer ate enough to go to his house to destroy evidence? The middle of nowhere is not much stronger than his home?</p>
<p>But Zhang Jianjun finally pointed to the light, and kneeled down to swear, even the ancestors are moved out, anyway, all kinds of assurance that he did not kill.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more bizarre is that two hours later, the police received a report that a body was found in the smoke bed of Bai Village, and the time of death was the latter part of last night, and the murderer was Zhang Jianjun!</p>
<p>The reason why we can be so sure of the murderer is that at the crime scene, the murderer left a handwriting: &ldquo;Murderer, me! Zhang Jianjun!&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The beard and I had been to the White Village before, so we knew a little about the situation here.</p>
<p>The villagers all grow tobacco, and the tobacco bed has become a very typical building here. To put it bluntly, it is a kind of simple house built with adobe.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the scene with Ma Sanshui, a cordon was drawn here.</p>
<p>Forgive me for being mentally prepared, but the moment I went in, my heart still stuttered.</p>
<p>The same killing method. A headless male corpse was hung by an iron hook, hanging from a beam inside the house, the upper half of his uniform and the floor, were distributed with dried blood.</p>
<p>And on a piece of wall in the smoke bed, simply too striking, were written two lines. The first line: &ldquo;Murderer, me! Zhang Jianjun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second line: &ldquo;No, beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beard and I exploded then. Beard cursed and grinned.</p>
<p>If it were normal, Ma Sanshui would have criticized the beard and told him to pay attention to quality. But at this time, he just sullen face.</p>
<p>In fact, which I do not understand, the beard&rsquo;s scolding, but also scolded the heart of everyone!</p>
<p>This murderer, simply arrogant can!</p>
<p>Of course, I in order to bite the right thing, deliberately asked the forensic pathologist: &ldquo;the time of death to determine the second half of last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He just pointed to the survey box.</p>
<p>Here sat a thermometer with some sticky, yellowish stuff stuck to it.</p>
<p>I guess he had just measured the anal temperature of the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s suspicion is ruled out?&rdquo; I thought silently.</p>
<p>Or unless Zhang Jianjun, a qigong master, knows some kind of diversion, which can appear in different places at the same time.</p>
<p>The police also brought in police dogs and searched extensively with the smoke bed as the center.</p>
<p>We all thought that the tape would be found again, but the result was nothing.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the forensic pathologist found a new bizarre.</p>
<p>The dead man&rsquo;s hand was clutching a screw.</p>
<p>At that time, in order to take it off, the forensic pathologist almost broke the corpse&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>
<p>It looks ordinary, in hardware stores or construction sites can be found everywhere, or walking in the street, get a bad pick up.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui stressed: this is an important clue, it is likely that the deceased to tell us something.</p>
<p>The problem is that the police have been studying for a long time, but in the end there is no accurate statement.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the deceased intended to say that the killer is a construction worker; others believe that this is instead a false clue deliberately left by the killer.</p>
<p>And then combined with the common and suspicious points of these two cases: the deceased had eaten a sumptuous dinner before death, wearing a very neat military uniform, the body itself is very smelly &hellip;&hellip; so these things.</p>
<p>The case was at once at an impasse.</p>
