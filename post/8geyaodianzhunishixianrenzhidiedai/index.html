  "articleBody": "The promotion path of people in the workplace is usually like this: employee –\u003e middle management –\u003e executive –\u003e VP level –\u003e entrepreneurial success CEO –\u003e investor –\u003e entrepreneurial success CEO –\u003e investor.\nThe cognitive ability of investors is considered the top level, because investors need to have enough ability to predict the industry trends and know the future direction, so as to discover companies with potential (high probability of success) for investment.\nEach layer of cognitive ability is different, and the higher the level of cognitive ability, the stronger. Some people can jump up, while others are still stuck at a certain stage and find it difficult to move up. So what level are you at? Have you ever thought about how to change the status quo?\nHere are a few typical elements of cognitive upgrading (only a brief introduction, and not extended. In-depth thinking about these elements is covered in other articles in the cognitive series).\nCritique of self Upgrade from “I know I’m right” to “How do I know I’m right”.\nThese are two ways of thinking.\n“I know I’m right” is the subconscious response of most people, who decide that they are right at the subjective level of consciousness when making decisions, stemming from the ego’s unconditional trust in itself.\n“How do I know I am right” is a typical expression of critical thinking. After the subjective consciousness makes a judgment, it does not rush to a conclusion first, but doubts the conclusion, must I be right, how did I determine that I am right. In the process of judging, what is the basis of my judgment, is my source of information accurate, and are there any omissions.\nThe former is ‘fast thinking’ and the latter is ‘slow thinking’. Fast thinking is an ability evolved by humans in the evolutionary process to adapt to survival, manifested as seeing the wind blowing and grass to run, there may be a tiger hidden inside, in ancient times, those who did not run were eaten by wild animals. Others and their views do not agree, will subconsciously refute.\nOffended by someone, will immediately angry, into a state of battle. It’s like Homo sapiens in the tribal era, when Homo sapiens from another tribe entered your territory and posed a threat to you.\nThinking fast was very useful when humans did not have basic security issues addressed. But in modern society, human survival and security problems have also been basically solved, and there are no wild animals on the street or in the office. So this kind of fast thinking will be overwhelmed and unable to adapt in the face of complex problems.\nSlow thinking is more useful in the modern fast-paced information age, asking more questions about why, rather than making immediate decisions based on intuition. Intuition can be right or wrong. By thinking about things from a different perspective, you can come to more reliable conclusions. As I gradually allowed myself not to rely on my intuition, I found that many things were not as simple as they appeared and that I was able to control my emotions.\nDon’t think of the solution as the problem itself. This phrase means that once you encounter a problem, don’t immediately look for a solution. Rather, first think, the problem is not the surface of the problem, whether there is a deeper problem. If a startup company is developing a new product and needs to hurry up and finish the development, but you find that your employees start to leave work on time and stop working hard, you may think that the problem is with the employees, if you think carefully about why the employees will leave work on time instead of trying to do a better job and create more value by working overtime in the company. It could be that the employee has something going on at home, or it could be that the employee doesn’t really understand why the company is rushing. Or it could be something else.\nThink outside the box Understand the limitations of human thinking caused by the evolution of the brain not keeping up with the technological explosion during the evolutionary process.\nNumerous facts show that the environment is changing so fast that natural selection (the evolution of the brain) has not kept pace.\nThe modern human brain evolved successfully 200,000 years ago.\nHowever, our brain capacity stopped growing 200,000 years ago. So, why didn’t the human brain get bigger? This may be because an increase in brain volume increases the risk of newborns at birth. In addition, our brain is a major energy consumer, consuming nearly 20% of our body’s energy, and if we increase its size, humans may not be able to meet the energy demands of the brain.\nThe science fiction novel “Three Bodies” refers to the “technological explosion”. Humanity entered the industrial revolution three hundred years ago, the information revolution (the fourth industrial revolution) a few decades ago, and in recent years to the era of artificial intelligence, on the scale of 200,000 years, whether hundreds of years or decades, if calculated proportionally, not even a moment, so there is a technology explosion of this statement.\nAs mentioned earlier, “fast thinking” is an evolutionary limitation of thinking.\nCognitive scientists Messier and Sperber wrote: “Rationality is an adaptive trait that humans evolved to help individuals be able to adapt to life in highly social groups.\nHumans did not evolve rationality to solve abstract, logical problems or to help us draw conclusions from messy data, but to solve a range of problems encountered in group collaboration. If the early groups of humans to work together were a group of irrational people exist, then the fate of the group would eventually inevitably implode and disband. Imagine a scenario where everyone thinks he or she is the smartest one and is very emotional, thinking that everyone else is retarded, then when the group gets together to discuss things, it basically starts with a fight and ends with a group fight.\nIf rationality were to solve abstract problems, logical problems, then the human brain would not have so many cognitive biases (intuitions and biases), such as the “halo effect”, “anchoring effect”, “survivor bias”, etc.\nCritical thinking The ability to think independently and not follow the crowd.\nThe first thing is to question.\nWhether the other side has an interest in the viewpoint, and what kind of starting point and purpose they have in thinking that way.\nHow much truth there is in a news report, and what possible truths may be hidden behind it.\nIn what time and context did the author of the book come to such conclusions.\nIs the information we have one side of the story.\nDo I agree with the other side because the other side shares my views.\n……\nThe next step is to gather information.\nWhat information is available on the other side of the conflict of interest with the other side.\nWhat other people who have a different point of view than the author have to say\nWhat are the stakeholders, what are their relationships like, and how do they trade with each other.\n……\nThen synthesize the analysis.\nWhich party has the most to gain from the whole event.\nHow does this matter affect me.\nHow do I need to respond.\nThis completes a process of independent thinking.\nKnow what you want Know the gap between fact and desire and the path of how to achieve the desire (goal).\nWhat is your goal.\nIn five years, what do you want yourself to be?\nWill you be smarter?\n……\nPrinciples to keep in mind in achieving your goals.\nDon’t focus on excelling, but rather on growing and improving\nA sense of accomplishment is the first self-driving force\nBe clear about the principles of goal setting\nBe clear about the possible reasons for not achieving your goals\nKnow the difference between the “what” and “why” way of thinking\n…….\nThe “what” and “why” are actually the difference between concrete and abstract ways of thinking.\nSay you have to do something: work 2 hours at night.\nA concrete mindset would think like this (what): you have to work 2 hours at night to finish a 3000-word document.\nThe abstract mindset would think something like this (why): What I’m going to do tonight will improve my writing.\nThe abstract way of thinking is the cause of the behavior, and the concrete way of thinking is the manifestation of the behavior. In contrast, the abstract way of thinking is more capable of giving motivation.\nMastering Methodology Have a methodology that works for you to make decisions.\nWhat is methodology. Methodology is the theory about the way people understand the world and transform the world. While worldview mainly solves the problem of “what” the world is, methodology mainly solves the problem of “how”. Methodology is a theoretical system or system aimed at solving problems, usually involving the discussion of problem stages, tasks, tools, and methodological techniques.\nA brief introduction to a methodology.\nWSR methodology - proposed in 1994 at HULL University in the UK by Chinese systems science experts Prof. Kifa Gu and Dr. Zhichang Zhu - is very foreign and consists of the initials of three words: physical (W), matter (S), and human (R). In simple terms, it means: what, how, and who.\n“Physics” refers to the mechanism involving the movement of matter, which includes both physics in a narrow sense, but also chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy and so on. It is usually necessary to use natural science knowledge to answer mainly what “matter” is, such as the law of gravity describing free fall, the genetic code carried by the double helix in DNA, and the principle of nuclear power plants to convert the huge energy produced by nuclear reactions into electricity. Physics requires realism, the study of objective reality. The knowledge imparted by university science and engineering schools is mainly used to solve various “physical” problems.\n“Theory” refers to the rationale for doing things, mainly addressing how to arrange all the equipment, materials, and personnel. Knowledge of operations research and management science is often used to answer the question of “how to do it”. Typical examples are the Apollo program, the construction of nuclear power plants, and the design and management of supply chains.\n“Humanism” refers to the rationale of being a human being, which usually requires knowledge of humanities and social sciences to answer the questions of “what should be done” and “how best to do it”. In real life, no matter what “things” and “things” are done without human beings, and it is also up to human beings to judge whether these things and things are properly applied, so system practice must fully consider the human factor.\nPictures We can learn from these methodologies rather than accepting them wholesale. The more generic a methodology is, the more abstract it indicates, and the more difficult it is to practice it. So it’s important to learn from them and make trade-offs with your personal situation. To translate the WSR methodology, we can understand “things” as “knowledge”, “things” as “tools”, and “people” as “human nature”.\nWith a slight transformation, a formula is derived.\nMethodology = knowledge base + thinking tools + benefit distribution.\nIf you want to cook for a few friends at home (to solve a problem), then you first need to go shopping for food (knowledge base), if a dish is not made before, then maybe you need to go online to find recipes to see how to cook (thinking tools), and discuss the division of labor among friends (benefit distribution) - who washes, cuts, stirs, and washing dishes.\nHave the ability to discover the nature of things Understanding the cause and effect relationships behind the laws of real things and dealing with reality.\nThere are scientists on the blue planet; Newton discovered gravity, Einstein published the theory of relativity, and Darwin published the doctrine of evolutionary natural selection. These are all great things that happened in the field of science. Scientists have been exploring the nature of their field of expertise.\nThere are 13 constants in our universe, so to speak, and the properties and behavior of our universe can be deduced from these numbers, and changing the value of any one of them would not constitute our present universe. These 13 constants include: the universal gravitational constant, the speed of light, absolute zero, Hubble’s constant, Planck’s constant, etc. The cosmological numbers are those constants that are related to the physical laws of the universe. Not all numbers related to the natural world are cosmic numbers. The number 10, which is the basis of the modern decimal system, is a human invention, chosen because it is the number of fingers of our hands.\nEven a well-known cosmic physicist has suggested that the nature of the fourth universe is a mathematical structure. We are not going to explore here whether these theories about the nature of the universe are plausible or not, but we are talking about an issue that is very relevant to us.\nOrdinary people do not have the ability or the need to explore scientific truth, but there are still many questions in the world that we should think about, such as the nature of business, the nature of industry, the nature of something.\nFor example.\nThe nature of business model: the transaction structure of stakeholders\nThe essence of photography: the photographer uses the lens to capture an emotional moment and deliver it to the audience\nThe essence of Internet products: to help users save time or to help them pass the time\nThe essence of fiction: build a virtual world with words to tell a story and immerse the reader in it\nThe essence of finance: transfer of value across time.\nThe essence of the Chinese people’s liberation cause: class struggle\nThe essence of Tencent: connecting everything\nThe essence of Ali: online commercial real estate\nThe essence of search engines: Passive advertising\nThe essence of today’s headlines: trainable active advertising\nThe essence of social e-commerce: the trust of consuming social relationships\nThinking about the essence of a thing allows us to quickly grasp the point, and also to see through the various disguises above the essence at a glance.\nSeeing the world from an evolutionary perspective Whether anything and behavior is valuable, the scale of value is relative to survival.\nThe main components of Darwin’s evolutionary doctrine of natural selection are: overpopulation, struggle for survival (also called competition for survival), heredity and variation, and survival of the fittest.\nDarwin’s doctrine of evolutionary natural selection emphasizes not evolution, but adaptation. Only organisms that adapt to changes in their surroundings will survive.\nIf you choose a goal, then everything should be judged around that goal to see if it is worthwhile.\nOur anxiety comes from not knowing where to start, there are many things to do and each one is important. But we all forget what our original purpose was. We have a direction, but in the process, we throw it aside. It’s as if direction and goals are left behind the moment we set them down.\nFor example, let’s say our goal is to move from senior manager to director in three years. But there are many things in life and in the process that we would like to do.\nLearn the methodology of Raising Cognitive Ability and practice it\nRead regularly to ensure the knowledge base\nMany courses on knowledge payment, “Economics Course at Peking University”, “Wu Jun Methodology”, “Classical Music from Amateur to Appreciation” all feel quite good and want to learn but have limited time.\nRecently released some blockbuster movies, I also want to go to see them, otherwise I will be out of touch with the people around me.\nMy friend quit her job and is going on a trip to Turkey and Paris, and I want to see the world too.\n……\nEverything looks valuable, and because of that, we become hard to choose and thus become anxious because we don’t have a standard to judge the value of a thing. This criterion is our goal, our desire.\nGoing back to the goal, since you want a promotion in your position, you should choose the first two. If your goal is to travel the world and entertain yourself, then choose the last two.\nIn business, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they are profitable for the business.\nIn life, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they contribute to the accomplishment of our personal goals.\nAchieve cognitive iteration Knowledge base and continuous learning.\nWe all know that the performance of a computer is determined by hardware (CPU, motherboard, memory, etc.) and operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and application software. If the hardware and operating system are consistent, the performance of the computer is determined by the application software.\nThe software and apps that run on the operating system, we call them programs. According to computer scientist von Neumann, program = data + algorithm. In fact operating system is also a specific program.\nIf we compare a person to a computer, then the human brain is the equivalent of the computer’s hardware, and the cognitive ability is the equivalent of the computer’s program. Cognitive ability (program) = learning method + knowledge base (data) + thinking style (algorithm).\nWhether it is continuous learning or lifelong learning, the purpose is the same effect as keeping the operating system and program updated and upgraded, so that the processing power of the human brain can be continuously improved.\nPictures Summary Generally speaking, people may have only certain elements, and in some elements a certain level. These elements interact with each other, and the process of cognitive upgrading is the upgrading of the proficiency level of mastery and use of the elements.\nThere is not a clear standard to state what tier has what criteria, it is recommended to start with a certain element to think deeply, practice and master.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>The promotion path of people in the workplace is usually like this: employee &ndash;&gt; middle management &ndash;&gt; executive &ndash;&gt; VP level &ndash;&gt; entrepreneurial success CEO &ndash;&gt; investor &ndash;&gt; entrepreneurial success CEO &ndash;&gt; investor.</p>
<p>The cognitive ability of investors is considered the top level, because investors need to have enough ability to predict the industry trends and know the future direction, so as to discover companies with potential (high probability of success) for investment.</p>
<p>Each layer of cognitive ability is different, and the higher the level of cognitive ability, the stronger. Some people can jump up, while others are still stuck at a certain stage and find it difficult to move up. So what level are you at? Have you ever thought about how to change the status quo?</p>
<p>Here are a few typical elements of cognitive upgrading (only a brief introduction, and not extended. In-depth thinking about these elements is covered in other articles in the cognitive series).</p>
<p>Critique of self
Upgrade from &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m right&rdquo; to &ldquo;How do I know I&rsquo;m right&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These are two ways of thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m right&rdquo; is the subconscious response of most people, who decide that they are right at the subjective level of consciousness when making decisions, stemming from the ego&rsquo;s unconditional trust in itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know I am right&rdquo; is a typical expression of critical thinking. After the subjective consciousness makes a judgment, it does not rush to a conclusion first, but doubts the conclusion, must I be right, how did I determine that I am right. In the process of judging, what is the basis of my judgment, is my source of information accurate, and are there any omissions.</p>
<p>The former is &lsquo;fast thinking&rsquo; and the latter is &lsquo;slow thinking&rsquo;. Fast thinking is an ability evolved by humans in the evolutionary process to adapt to survival, manifested as seeing the wind blowing and grass to run, there may be a tiger hidden inside, in ancient times, those who did not run were eaten by wild animals. Others and their views do not agree, will subconsciously refute.</p>
<p>Offended by someone, will immediately angry, into a state of battle. It&rsquo;s like Homo sapiens in the tribal era, when Homo sapiens from another tribe entered your territory and posed a threat to you.</p>
<p>Thinking fast was very useful when humans did not have basic security issues addressed. But in modern society, human survival and security problems have also been basically solved, and there are no wild animals on the street or in the office. So this kind of fast thinking will be overwhelmed and unable to adapt in the face of complex problems.</p>
<p>Slow thinking is more useful in the modern fast-paced information age, asking more questions about why, rather than making immediate decisions based on intuition. Intuition can be right or wrong. By thinking about things from a different perspective, you can come to more reliable conclusions. As I gradually allowed myself not to rely on my intuition, I found that many things were not as simple as they appeared and that I was able to control my emotions.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think of the solution as the problem itself. This phrase means that once you encounter a problem, don&rsquo;t immediately look for a solution. Rather, first think, the problem is not the surface of the problem, whether there is a deeper problem. If a startup company is developing a new product and needs to hurry up and finish the development, but you find that your employees start to leave work on time and stop working hard, you may think that the problem is with the employees, if you think carefully about why the employees will leave work on time instead of trying to do a better job and create more value by working overtime in the company. It could be that the employee has something going on at home, or it could be that the employee doesn&rsquo;t really understand why the company is rushing. Or it could be something else.</p>
<p>Think outside the box
Understand the limitations of human thinking caused by the evolution of the brain not keeping up with the technological explosion during the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Numerous facts show that the environment is changing so fast that natural selection (the evolution of the brain) has not kept pace.</p>
<p>The modern human brain evolved successfully 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>However, our brain capacity stopped growing 200,000 years ago. So, why didn&rsquo;t the human brain get bigger? This may be because an increase in brain volume increases the risk of newborns at birth. In addition, our brain is a major energy consumer, consuming nearly 20% of our body&rsquo;s energy, and if we increase its size, humans may not be able to meet the energy demands of the brain.</p>
<p>The science fiction novel &ldquo;Three Bodies&rdquo; refers to the &ldquo;technological explosion&rdquo;. Humanity entered the industrial revolution three hundred years ago, the information revolution (the fourth industrial revolution) a few decades ago, and in recent years to the era of artificial intelligence, on the scale of 200,000 years, whether hundreds of years or decades, if calculated proportionally, not even a moment, so there is a technology explosion of this statement.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, &ldquo;fast thinking&rdquo; is an evolutionary limitation of thinking.</p>
<p>Cognitive scientists Messier and Sperber wrote: &ldquo;Rationality is an adaptive trait that humans evolved to help individuals be able to adapt to life in highly social groups.</p>
<p>Humans did not evolve rationality to solve abstract, logical problems or to help us draw conclusions from messy data, but to solve a range of problems encountered in group collaboration. If the early groups of humans to work together were a group of irrational people exist, then the fate of the group would eventually inevitably implode and disband. Imagine a scenario where everyone thinks he or she is the smartest one and is very emotional, thinking that everyone else is retarded, then when the group gets together to discuss things, it basically starts with a fight and ends with a group fight.</p>
<p>If rationality were to solve abstract problems, logical problems, then the human brain would not have so many cognitive biases (intuitions and biases), such as the &ldquo;halo effect&rdquo;, &ldquo;anchoring effect&rdquo;, &ldquo;survivor bias&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Critical thinking
The ability to think independently and not follow the crowd.</p>
<p>The first thing is to question.</p>
<p>Whether the other side has an interest in the viewpoint, and what kind of starting point and purpose they have in thinking that way.</p>
<p>How much truth there is in a news report, and what possible truths may be hidden behind it.</p>
<p>In what time and context did the author of the book come to such conclusions.</p>
<p>Is the information we have one side of the story.</p>
<p>Do I agree with the other side because the other side shares my views.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The next step is to gather information.</p>
<p>What information is available on the other side of the conflict of interest with the other side.</p>
<p>What other people who have a different point of view than the author have to say</p>
<p>What are the stakeholders, what are their relationships like, and how do they trade with each other.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Then synthesize the analysis.</p>
<p>Which party has the most to gain from the whole event.</p>
<p>How does this matter affect me.</p>
<p>How do I need to respond.</p>
<p>This completes a process of independent thinking.</p>
<p>Know what you want
Know the gap between fact and desire and the path of how to achieve the desire (goal).</p>
<p>What is your goal.</p>
<p>In five years, what do you want yourself to be?</p>
<p>Will you be smarter?</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Principles to keep in mind in achieving your goals.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t focus on excelling, but rather on growing and improving</p>
<p>A sense of accomplishment is the first self-driving force</p>
<p>Be clear about the principles of goal setting</p>
<p>Be clear about the possible reasons for not achieving your goals</p>
<p>Know the difference between the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; way of thinking</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; are actually the difference between concrete and abstract ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Say you have to do something: work 2 hours at night.</p>
<p>A concrete mindset would think like this (what): you have to work 2 hours at night to finish a 3000-word document.</p>
<p>The abstract mindset would think something like this (why): What I&rsquo;m going to do tonight will improve my writing.</p>
<p>The abstract way of thinking is the cause of the behavior, and the concrete way of thinking is the manifestation of the behavior. In contrast, the abstract way of thinking is more capable of giving motivation.</p>
<p>Mastering Methodology
Have a methodology that works for you to make decisions.</p>
<p>What is methodology. Methodology is the theory about the way people understand the world and transform the world. While worldview mainly solves the problem of &ldquo;what&rdquo; the world is, methodology mainly solves the problem of &ldquo;how&rdquo;. Methodology is a theoretical system or system aimed at solving problems, usually involving the discussion of problem stages, tasks, tools, and methodological techniques.</p>
<p>A brief introduction to a methodology.</p>
<p>WSR methodology - proposed in 1994 at HULL University in the UK by Chinese systems science experts Prof. Kifa Gu and Dr. Zhichang Zhu - is very foreign and consists of the initials of three words: physical (W), matter (S), and human (R). In simple terms, it means: what, how, and who.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physics&rdquo; refers to the mechanism involving the movement of matter, which includes both physics in a narrow sense, but also chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy and so on. It is usually necessary to use natural science knowledge to answer mainly what &ldquo;matter&rdquo; is, such as the law of gravity describing free fall, the genetic code carried by the double helix in DNA, and the principle of nuclear power plants to convert the huge energy produced by nuclear reactions into electricity. Physics requires realism, the study of objective reality. The knowledge imparted by university science and engineering schools is mainly used to solve various &ldquo;physical&rdquo; problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theory&rdquo; refers to the rationale for doing things, mainly addressing how to arrange all the equipment, materials, and personnel. Knowledge of operations research and management science is often used to answer the question of &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo;. Typical examples are the Apollo program, the construction of nuclear power plants, and the design and management of supply chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humanism&rdquo; refers to the rationale of being a human being, which usually requires knowledge of humanities and social sciences to answer the questions of &ldquo;what should be done&rdquo; and &ldquo;how best to do it&rdquo;. In real life, no matter what &ldquo;things&rdquo; and &ldquo;things&rdquo; are done without human beings, and it is also up to human beings to judge whether these things and things are properly applied, so system practice must fully consider the human factor.</p>
<p>Pictures
We can learn from these methodologies rather than accepting them wholesale. The more generic a methodology is, the more abstract it indicates, and the more difficult it is to practice it. So it&rsquo;s important to learn from them and make trade-offs with your personal situation. To translate the WSR methodology, we can understand &ldquo;things&rdquo; as &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, &ldquo;things&rdquo; as &ldquo;tools&rdquo;, and &ldquo;people&rdquo; as &ldquo;human nature&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a slight transformation, a formula is derived.</p>
<p>Methodology = knowledge base + thinking tools + benefit distribution.</p>
<p>If you want to cook for a few friends at home (to solve a problem), then you first need to go shopping for food (knowledge base), if a dish is not made before, then maybe you need to go online to find recipes to see how to cook (thinking tools), and discuss the division of labor among friends (benefit distribution) - who washes, cuts, stirs, and washing dishes.</p>
<p>Have the ability to discover the nature of things
Understanding the cause and effect relationships behind the laws of real things and dealing with reality.</p>
<p>There are scientists on the blue planet; Newton discovered gravity, Einstein published the theory of relativity, and Darwin published the doctrine of evolutionary natural selection. These are all great things that happened in the field of science. Scientists have been exploring the nature of their field of expertise.</p>
<p>There are 13 constants in our universe, so to speak, and the properties and behavior of our universe can be deduced from these numbers, and changing the value of any one of them would not constitute our present universe. These 13 constants include: the universal gravitational constant, the speed of light, absolute zero, Hubble&rsquo;s constant, Planck&rsquo;s constant, etc. The cosmological numbers are those constants that are related to the physical laws of the universe. Not all numbers related to the natural world are cosmic numbers. The number 10, which is the basis of the modern decimal system, is a human invention, chosen because it is the number of fingers of our hands.</p>
<p>Even a well-known cosmic physicist has suggested that the nature of the fourth universe is a mathematical structure. We are not going to explore here whether these theories about the nature of the universe are plausible or not, but we are talking about an issue that is very relevant to us.</p>
<p>Ordinary people do not have the ability or the need to explore scientific truth, but there are still many questions in the world that we should think about, such as the nature of business, the nature of industry, the nature of something.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>The nature of business model: the transaction structure of stakeholders</p>
<p>The essence of photography: the photographer uses the lens to capture an emotional moment and deliver it to the audience</p>
<p>The essence of Internet products: to help users save time or to help them pass the time</p>
<p>The essence of fiction: build a virtual world with words to tell a story and immerse the reader in it</p>
<p>The essence of finance: transfer of value across time.</p>
<p>The essence of the Chinese people&rsquo;s liberation cause: class struggle</p>
<p>The essence of Tencent: connecting everything</p>
<p>The essence of Ali: online commercial real estate</p>
<p>The essence of search engines: Passive advertising</p>
<p>The essence of today&rsquo;s headlines: trainable active advertising</p>
<p>The essence of social e-commerce: the trust of consuming social relationships</p>
<p>Thinking about the essence of a thing allows us to quickly grasp the point, and also to see through the various disguises above the essence at a glance.</p>
<p>Seeing the world from an evolutionary perspective
Whether anything and behavior is valuable, the scale of value is relative to survival.</p>
<p>The main components of Darwin&rsquo;s evolutionary doctrine of natural selection are: overpopulation, struggle for survival (also called competition for survival), heredity and variation, and survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Darwin&rsquo;s doctrine of evolutionary natural selection emphasizes not evolution, but adaptation. Only organisms that adapt to changes in their surroundings will survive.</p>
<p>If you choose a goal, then everything should be judged around that goal to see if it is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Our anxiety comes from not knowing where to start, there are many things to do and each one is important. But we all forget what our original purpose was. We have a direction, but in the process, we throw it aside. It&rsquo;s as if direction and goals are left behind the moment we set them down.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say our goal is to move from senior manager to director in three years. But there are many things in life and in the process that we would like to do.</p>
<p>Learn the methodology of Raising Cognitive Ability and practice it</p>
<p>Read regularly to ensure the knowledge base</p>
<p>Many courses on knowledge payment, &ldquo;Economics Course at Peking University&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wu Jun Methodology&rdquo;, &ldquo;Classical Music from Amateur to Appreciation&rdquo; all feel quite good and want to learn but have limited time.</p>
<p>Recently released some blockbuster movies, I also want to go to see them, otherwise I will be out of touch with the people around me.</p>
<p>My friend quit her job and is going on a trip to Turkey and Paris, and I want to see the world too.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Everything looks valuable, and because of that, we become hard to choose and thus become anxious because we don&rsquo;t have a standard to judge the value of a thing. This criterion is our goal, our desire.</p>
<p>Going back to the goal, since you want a promotion in your position, you should choose the first two. If your goal is to travel the world and entertain yourself, then choose the last two.</p>
<p>In business, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they are profitable for the business.</p>
<p>In life, we should judge the value of things in terms of whether they contribute to the accomplishment of our personal goals.</p>
<p>Achieve cognitive iteration
Knowledge base and continuous learning.</p>
<p>We all know that the performance of a computer is determined by hardware (CPU, motherboard, memory, etc.) and operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and application software. If the hardware and operating system are consistent, the performance of the computer is determined by the application software.</p>
<p>The software and apps that run on the operating system, we call them programs. According to computer scientist von Neumann, program = data + algorithm. In fact operating system is also a specific program.</p>
<p>If we compare a person to a computer, then the human brain is the equivalent of the computer&rsquo;s hardware, and the cognitive ability is the equivalent of the computer&rsquo;s program. Cognitive ability (program) = learning method + knowledge base (data) + thinking style (algorithm).</p>
<p>Whether it is continuous learning or lifelong learning, the purpose is the same effect as keeping the operating system and program updated and upgraded, so that the processing power of the human brain can be continuously improved.</p>

Summary
Generally speaking, people may have only certain elements, and in some elements a certain level. These elements interact with each other, and the process of cognitive upgrading is the upgrading of the proficiency level of mastery and use of the elements.</p>
<p>There is not a clear standard to state what tier has what criteria, it is recommended to start with a certain element to think deeply, practice and master.</p>
