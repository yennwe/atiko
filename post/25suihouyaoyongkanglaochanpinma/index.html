I would like to ask Uncle Mo, what are the safe anti-aging products? As I mentioned in my previous article, since life has entered sexual reproduction, the laws of nature seem to favor the DNA carried in the cells of living beings to be immortalized through the generations, and living beings become a shell, and the meaning of a short life seems to be to pass the DNA, the key object of protection, to the next generation.\nLife Train\nI watched a Japanese anime that described life in this way:\n“From the moment the train starts (your birth), there will be different people getting on and getting off.\n“Some of these people will be on the train for a short time, and some will be on the train for a long time, and they are the people who will cross paths with you in your life.\n“Eventually, the train comes to an end and stops (at the end of life).”\nMy heart was heavy at that time after reading it. It wasn’t until many years later that I understood the laws of nature and was relieved.\nProgrammed aging\nSince we were born, our body seems to be going through a programmed aging process, let’s review:\nEmbryo (fertilization ~ 8 weeks after fertilization) The sperm and egg meet and begin to form a fertilized egg.\nFetus (10th week of pregnancy to birth) Various organs begin to be formed and perfected.\nInfant (0~12 months) During the breastfeeding period, milk teeth begin to form.\n4)Infant (1~3 years old)\nLearning to walk.\nChildhood / Adolescence (4~11 years old) Teeth are replaced.\nAdolescence (12~19 years old) Rapid growth in height and weight, male and female maturity.\nAdulthood (20~60 years old) Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 49 and 52, and women lose their fertility;\nAt the age of 50, hair starts to turn gray.\n8)Old age (61 years old and above)\nNearly half of all people over the age of 75 have hearing loss;\nOver age 80, nearly half of Americans have cataracts.\nFrom top to bottom, this is the stage we all go through, like a fixed coding program, since the formation of a fertilized egg, it has been imprinted in our cells, carrying out the programmed aging.\nHave you ever marveled? What are the forces that control our growth, development and aging so precisely?\nThe basic units that make up our cells are all inanimate chemical molecules. It’s fascinating to me that these simple or complex chemical molecules act like a machine that precisely controls our body’s programmed growth and aging process at different time periods!\nThe biological clock of aging\nIn every living organism, there seems to be such a precise biological clock of aging.\nFor example:\nThe growth of milk teeth begins between 6 and 8 months of age;\nPuberty begins at the age of 12 to 13 years;\nMenopause occurs at the age of 49-52;\nHair graying occurs at about 50 years of age;\n……\nWe still don’t know the mechanism of how all this happens? This is the reason why it is repeatedly emphasized and described:\nWe don’t know why the human body ages? If we don’t even know the mechanism of aging, how can we talk about anti-aging? How is it possible to achieve?\nWith the progress of life science research, some explanations for the aging mechanism have emerged, such as DNA damage.\nDNA damage\nOne study showed that dogs can lose about 3.3% of their cardiac myocyte DNA per year, while humans lose about 0.6% of their myocardial DNA per year.\nTherefore, some scientists believe that genetic damage to DNA may be the central cause of aging in humans.\nDNA is a long, double-stranded spiral, and the genes that determine our body’s hair and skin are small segments of that long chain.\nIf you think of DNA as a long chain, then genes are like a section of the chain. There are about 20,000 to 30,000 genes in our human DNA, which is only 1.5% of the length of the DNA chain.\nAccording to the theory of DNA damage, we lose about 0.6% of our DNA every year during the continuous cell replication and division, and this accumulated damage leads to our aging step by step.\nOf course, this is only one of the speculations on the mechanism of human aging, according to the current level of technology, we can not stop the DNA damage, and we can not really fight against aging.\nThere are other speculations about aging, such as DNA methylation, telomere theory, waste accumulation, free radical theory, and so on. One of the speculations about free radicals involves antioxidants, which we have mentioned in previous chapters.\nAnti-aging drugs\nA number of anti-aging supplements, skin care products, and pharmaceuticals have appeared on the market.\nOf these 3 products, drugs are more credible because they must be supported by experimental data and human clinical data to be marketed. Health supplements and skin care products, on the other hand, are all “talk” products with no credible data to support their effectiveness.\nSome studies have shown that calorie-restricted diets can extend the life span of some animals. Some calorie-restricted analog drugs, such as rapamycin and metformin, are also being studied. However, no human clinical data have been reported.\nThat is to say, there are no potent drugs that can understandably fight aging. After all, we don’t know what causes our bodies to age until now.\nFor those products that claim to be anti-aging when applied to the skin or taken orally, just listen to them and don’t take them seriously.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Should I use anti-aging products after the age of 25?
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told to prevent aging in advance, but do I really need to use anti-aging skin care products after 25? I would like to ask Uncle Mo, what are the safe anti-aging products?
As I mentioned in my previous article, since life has entered sexual reproduction, the laws of nature seem to favor the DNA carried in the cells of living beings to be immortalized through the generations, and living beings become a shell, and the meaning of a short life seems to be to pass the DNA, the key object of protection, to the next generation.</p>
<p>Life Train</p>
<p>I watched a Japanese anime that described life in this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the moment the train starts (your birth), there will be different people getting on and getting off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these people will be on the train for a short time, and some will be on the train for a long time, and they are the people who will cross paths with you in your life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, the train comes to an end and stops (at the end of life).&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart was heavy at that time after reading it. It wasn&rsquo;t until many years later that I understood the laws of nature and was relieved.</p>
<p>Programmed aging</p>
<p>Since we were born, our body seems to be going through a programmed aging process, let&rsquo;s review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embryo (fertilization ~ 8 weeks after fertilization)</li>
</ol>
<p>The sperm and egg meet and begin to form a fertilized egg.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Fetus (10th week of pregnancy to birth)</li>
</ol>
<p>Various organs begin to be formed and perfected.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Infant (0~12 months)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the breastfeeding period, milk teeth begin to form.</p>
<p>4)Infant (1~3 years old)</p>
<p>Learning to walk.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Childhood / Adolescence (4~11 years old)</li>
</ol>
<p>Teeth are replaced.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Adolescence (12~19 years old)</li>
</ol>
<p>Rapid growth in height and weight, male and female maturity.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Adulthood (20~60 years old)</li>
</ol>
<p>Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 49 and 52, and women lose their fertility;</p>
<p>At the age of 50, hair starts to turn gray.</p>
<p>8)Old age (61 years old and above)</p>
<p>Nearly half of all people over the age of 75 have hearing loss;</p>
<p>Over age 80, nearly half of Americans have cataracts.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, this is the stage we all go through, like a fixed coding program, since the formation of a fertilized egg, it has been imprinted in our cells, carrying out the programmed aging.</p>
<p>Have you ever marveled? What are the forces that control our growth, development and aging so precisely?</p>
<p>The basic units that make up our cells are all inanimate chemical molecules. It&rsquo;s fascinating to me that these simple or complex chemical molecules act like a machine that precisely controls our body&rsquo;s programmed growth and aging process at different time periods!</p>
<p>The biological clock of aging</p>
<p>In every living organism, there seems to be such a precise biological clock of aging.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>The growth of milk teeth begins between 6 and 8 months of age;</p>
<p>Puberty begins at the age of 12 to 13 years;</p>
<p>Menopause occurs at the age of 49-52;</p>
<p>Hair graying occurs at about 50 years of age;</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t know the mechanism of how all this happens? This is the reason why it is repeatedly emphasized and described:</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why the human body ages? If we don&rsquo;t even know the mechanism of aging, how can we talk about anti-aging? How is it possible to achieve?</p>
<p>With the progress of life science research, some explanations for the aging mechanism have emerged, such as DNA damage.</p>
<p>DNA damage</p>
<p>One study showed that dogs can lose about 3.3% of their cardiac myocyte DNA per year, while humans lose about 0.6% of their myocardial DNA per year.</p>
<p>Therefore, some scientists believe that genetic damage to DNA may be the central cause of aging in humans.</p>
<p>DNA is a long, double-stranded spiral, and the genes that determine our body&rsquo;s hair and skin are small segments of that long chain.</p>
<p>If you think of DNA as a long chain, then genes are like a section of the chain. There are about 20,000 to 30,000 genes in our human DNA, which is only 1.5% of the length of the DNA chain.</p>
<p>According to the theory of DNA damage, we lose about 0.6% of our DNA every year during the continuous cell replication and division, and this accumulated damage leads to our aging step by step.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only one of the speculations on the mechanism of human aging, according to the current level of technology, we can not stop the DNA damage, and we can not really fight against aging.</p>
<p>There are other speculations about aging, such as DNA methylation, telomere theory, waste accumulation, free radical theory, and so on. One of the speculations about free radicals involves antioxidants, which we have mentioned in previous chapters.</p>
<p>Anti-aging drugs</p>
<p>A number of anti-aging supplements, skin care products, and pharmaceuticals have appeared on the market.</p>
<p>Of these 3 products, drugs are more credible because they must be supported by experimental data and human clinical data to be marketed. Health supplements and skin care products, on the other hand, are all &ldquo;talk&rdquo; products with no credible data to support their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that calorie-restricted diets can extend the life span of some animals. Some calorie-restricted analog drugs, such as rapamycin and metformin, are also being studied. However, no human clinical data have been reported.</p>
<p>That is to say, there are no potent drugs that can understandably fight aging. After all, we don&rsquo;t know what causes our bodies to age until now.</p>
<p>For those products that claim to be anti-aging when applied to the skin or taken orally, just listen to them and don&rsquo;t take them seriously.</p>
