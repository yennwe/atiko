  "articleBody": "“Murder is sacred”: he is the only criminal with the word “ghost” in his criminal file! Killing is ritualistic!\n“Why does everyone tell me that I can’t stay longer at the train station?” This is a question that many people have asked.\nLet’s say an answer in my mind: because it is haunted and murderous!\nThis is also a real event that happened many years ago.\nPutting aside the superstition, it is really haunted! This is the only murder case in the country’s criminal records that has the word “ghost” in it.\nHow spooky is it? The ghost came down from the sky and floated away after killing; how cruel and bizarre is the method? Cruel to look at the corpse, the professionals were scared not to speak; bizarre to the local police held a case analysis meeting, but the whole confused!\nAt that time, a train station in Shaanxi once became a forbidden place, so many people stop!\nIf you are interested, I, as a personal experience, will write about what happened at the time, to restore it perfectly.\nBut also a reminder: resistance to stress is small, please stop here, because the next part of the scene, will cause all kinds of discomfort.\nMarch 3, 1994\nLet’s start with this day. In the early morning after the fog, we were standing in front of some roadbed berm on the northwest side of the train station in the city of Valium.\nEveryone looked bad, no one was talking, and the atmosphere was cold. Only the forensic scientist squatted in front of the body, doing various examinations.\nThis is an elderly male corpse, naked, tied hands, kneeling on the ground, making an atonement-like kowtow.\nHis clothes, all neatly folded aside, but only missing the autumn pants. Because the pants were put on his head.\nObviously, the murderer intended to do it.\nForensics also lifted the pants, but that moment, the people who saw all revolted.\nThe whole face of the deceased was a bit collapsed, especially on the brain shell, it was simply a pit after another pit.\n“A total of 11 contusions (blunt force trauma caused by fracture type), each fatal!” The coroner said to us.\nThat sounded contradictory. I thought to myself: if each of them could kill a person, why did the killer hit him eleven times? And if the body had been stripped naked, why did he cover his head again?\nAnd the murder scene.\nNot far from the body, there is a burned paper circles. It was drawn with a tree branch.\nMy guess is that after the murder, the killer just burned the paper at the murder scene. But what was the purpose? A sacrifice to someone?\nIn addition, the scene did not leave much blood, which is also directly related to the murder weapon. I guess the murder weapon is a hammer, with this thing to hit the head, to vulgarity, are internal injuries.\nNext to the burned paper circle, in addition to scattered scratched matches, but also distributed a large number and disorderly footprints.\nI looked at them in comparison, not the deceased.\n“What did the killer do at that time?” I am full of question marks. Incidentally, I observed these footprints, especially focus on picking out a few to try to simulate themselves, to see how can also step out of a similar track.\nFinally, I came up with a ridiculous idea: he was dancing!\nImagine the scene: the hot corpse kneeling here, the killer and a fire with coins, and then, he danced in the firelight!\n2\nI’d like to introduce myself. I was a special professional in the nineties - the grey eyes and ears of special cases, which is also the predecessor of 321 (criminal special intelligence).\nThe people who came here know that the era of the big cases and important cases more, the police force is seriously inadequate, and like me a slight skill of the released prisoners, was “recruited” to become a force like a supporting force.\nLet’s go back to this case.\nIn the morning, the large conference room of the Public Security Bureau of Stabilization City was filled with smoke.\nThe participants all had serious faces. It is not an exaggeration to say that everyone was confused.\nThis is the second murder case in a row in the last week. The modus operandi was almost identical.\nThe victims were both elderly males. One was 56 years old, one was 52 years old, and both were found with unchecked tickets in their belongings, thus judging that both were passengers. Also no cash was found.\nIn response to the two murders, there are differing views within the police.\nSome people believe that the killer is a pure pervert, the elderly and infirm men as the target, essentially robbing the main; but others believe that this is a typical case of revenge killing, the 11 thwarted trauma, is a manifestation of the abuse of the body to vent their anger.\nOf course, my partner beard and I, once a prison oil (prison head prison bully), and did not participate in the whole meeting. Later, the two of us, with the upper line (detective) Ma Sanshui together to hide in the next room.\nMa Sanshui smoked one cigarette after another.\n“I’m scared!” He suddenly opened his mouth and came out with this sentence.\nBeard and I looked at each other.\n“Brother Shui, you are an old bird who has seen the storm, this case, and only two people died, what is the fear?” Beard said, and gave Ma Sanshui a cigarette refill.\nMa Sanshui very serious stare at us both: “This has nothing to do with how many people died! In other cases, even if more people died, but as long as the crime scene, I can more or less understand the psychology of the killer, but this time, which of you can tell me, the killer in the end what?”\nThe table was originally bashed with a pile of information, all about the dead.\nHe deliberately pushed the information toward us. “A revenge killing? The two dead, a stuttering welder, a crippled peddler selling kang buns (sesame cakes), what juxtaposition do they have? As for the robbery, where there are such robbers? Dedicated to robbing the poor, but also burn paper and dance to celebrate?”\nThe beard and I did not know how to answer.\nMa Sanshui took a few more puffs of muffled smoke, a change of topic: “At present, this is also a serial murder case. This kind of serial cases, there is often a cooling-off period, but the 2nd 28th kill a person, today March 3, another dead. It’s too fast! And so far, we don’t even have any information about the killer, as it is ……”\nHe a sigh.\nBeard seemed to think of something and rubbed his hands, “Brother Shui, we may have information on the killer.”\n“What do you mean?” Ma Sanshui asked.\nBeard mentioned a word: “Ghost.”\n3\nI understood what the beard meant. More than a month ago, more than one passenger responded that the Anding train station was haunted at night.\nIn fact, in those days, haunted things often, but mainly blackmail.\nThe ghost of the station alone, the police also sent people to investigate, collected information on this, and eventually, according to the information, to make a sketch of it.\nBeard and I have seen. The first feeling, called the ghost is okay, or called the goblin is also okay. Anyway, it is covered with furry.\nBeard even gave it a nickname: Hairy Boy!\nI guess, the beard is to remind Ma Sanshui, the ghost could be the murderer pretending to be it?\nBut then, the mystery is more, the killer impersonated it to do what?\nMa Sanshui heard the beard’s reminder, the first reaction was to say back: “Bullshit!”\nBut he is not like other police officers, not so dead brain.\nWait and silently pondered some more. He ordered: “Let’s do this, you two go to verify the matter again. Remember, everything must be based on facts, bite the right!”\nNext, while the two of us launched an investigation, the police also had action.\nEspecially according to several discussions and analysis, combined with the scene left shoe prints and other features, the police to the criminals made a “profile”: male perpetrators, aged 20-35 years old, about 1.7 meters tall, carrying a short-handled masonry hammer, withdrawn and introverted personality, psychological disorders, good alone activities or single living alone. Familiar with the situation of Anding station, in Anding has a fixed residence.\nOf course, at the bottom of this “profile” description, there is a note: the perpetrator is likely to have only a junior high school education, may also have been dealt with by the public security organs, and economic difficulties, waiting for money.\nI know that “profiling” is very profound, almost all the criminal investigation professional things. As the eyes and ears, I once tried to backtrack, wondering what the police are based on to reach these conclusions. But finally gave up. The difficulty is too great.\nThe police have been using “profiling” as a basis, and almost all of them are out there. The police were almost all over the place, centered on the station, and started a search in a three-kilometer radius. I remember when everyone was shouting slogans: task to group, responsibility to the person. Whether in the road, urban, rural, as long as in the lock area, all do not let go.\nFor a while, the beard and I even dare not open the walkie-talkie, because both the main frequency or alternative channels, it is simply a cacophony of people, chaos and a pot of porridge.\nEveryone either asked each other about the progress, or someone reported that he had found the suspect.\nLook at it this way, the beard and I took advantage of a handful, after all, we two are not so strong, just simply to investigate the ghost matter.\nOriginally, I also intended to strictly follow the implementation of what Ma Sanshui said, the ghost incident in the factual basis for the full collection of things over, but in fact, I found that simply can not do.\nA person in the know: the night he rode in the car, he did see a ghost! The ghost fanned its wings, furry and descended from the sky, and after a face-to-face meeting with him, it fanned its wings and flew into the foggy night.\nAnother informant was even more outrageous, he insisted: the ghost appeared in the blink of an eye, and in the blink of an eye, it disappeared without a trace.\nI did not say anything at the time. The bearded man, once anxious, questioned those in the know: “Flying into the sky? Suddenly appear and disappear? Damn, your heads are not farted?”\nThanks to my mediation, otherwise these people in the know really want to go to Ma Sanshui that a complaint, saying that the beard rude and so on, it is estimated that he will have to be locked up for a few days.\nThis wavered to two days later in the evening, the beard and I returned to the residence.\nWe both ate boxed meals, bearded originally and I chatted, but I tend to slip, the heart still thinking about the case.\n“Old Ge, off duty! Relax, let’s talk about the big girl is good?” He interrupted me again this time.\nThen he pointed out the window: “You say this foggy day, those big girls are hiding at home why? Wouldn’t they also be thinking about handsome guys?”\nMy brain like a sudden electric current, and even a jolt, hands loose, chopsticks are dropped on the floor.\nThe bearded man shushed me: “Talking about the big girl, look how excited you are!”\nHe was about to help me pick up the chopsticks.\nBut I grabbed his hand.\nHe was startled: “What are you doing? Look at your thieving eyes, remind you, I’m a man!”\n“Misty! Misty!” I was in a hurry, I could only pop out one word at a time.\nSee the beard still look confused, I swallowed hard, and reminded: “What happened the night of the two murders?”\n“Fog ah!” Beard replied.\n“Then think again, when we investigate ghosts, those in the know said that the night of the ghosts, what was the weather?”\n“Fog! Fog fog!” Beard slowed down after half a beat, read aloud and repeatedly, but do not forget that he is still eating. The result caused my face a moment sticky a lot of rice grains.\nI could not care less about this, after wiping casually, also pointed out the window: “Tonight there is fog! And big!”\n4\nMarch 6, 1994\nI don’t know much about geography and meteorology, but in the city of Valium, every late winter/early spring season, there is frequent fog at night.\nThe beard and I discussed some more, and both agreed: the killer likes to be out in the foggy days. Although the specific reason is still unknown, but if we really guessed right, this night will be a focus.\nAt that time there was no cell phone, and even only the models deserve to have a big brother. I in order to report this guess to Ma Sanshui in a timely manner, it continuously paged him (BB), and even gave him a Han Hsien reminder: fog!\nUnfortunately, he never called back.\nI discussed with the beard, so we both went to the train station overnight.\nOnly one purpose: patrol, to prevent further tragedies.\nAlso take into account the night is too cold, we both in addition to wrapped in a thick cotton jacket, also each wearing a dogskin hat.\nThat shape, think about it, even if the more serious people, wearing it, are a bit of a blind man’s feeling.\nI remember that the two murders happened between two and four in the morning, so I pinpointed the time, just after two, we both walked back and forth along the platform.\nAlso because we are very tired during the day, and now the night and back-to-back, the beard eventually some can not stay up, once with me spit: “Almost have to it.”\n“I’m afraid that when we go back, the killer will appear again in time!” I said my fears.\n“There is no such coincidence!” He waved a big hand.\nBut soon, when the two of us out of the station, out of the northwest side of another large, not to mention him, even my eyes widened.\nThere was the firelight! In the night fog, it was hazy, but also very conspicuous.\n“Burning, burning paper?” Beard chanted.\nI did not answer him positively.\nAt this moment I have a deer in my heart, it crashes around a lot.\nI gestured to the beard, afraid to talk now delay.\nI mean: go to the other of the tracks, under the cover of the slope, we sneak past.\nIt’s a chore! Because we have to walk the duck walk. That is, the kind of half-crouching walk.\nDo not look at the short distance of one hundred and eighty meters, and finally my crotch shaft are sore, but wait to lie down on the tracks, and then so close to observe, there is indeed someone burning paper, he is also wearing a black trench coat, in addition he is also dancing weird.\nBeard and I are pressed, I deliberately and carefully look for some, no body found.\nSo, he was burning paper and dancing before bringing people here to kill? I thought.\nAfter another ten seconds or so, the beard can not sink.\nThis kid is, after all, the prison oil origin, the hands of no one. He bowed, like a leopard, and so noiselessly stepped over the tracks, he suddenly spring up like a spring and pounced.\nA hungry tiger pounced on him. The man grunted miserably, the face rushed down by the beard sat on the ground.\nI was thinking, how to play next to help themselves? But the beard eeked, then even jumped up, playing a life to escape to my side.\nI completely froze, thinking that in the end what happened?\nBeard came back and pushed me hard, that means, you rushed!\nLooking at the killer immediately stood up, I put aside all distracting thoughts.\nI do not beard that move, so after rushing over, directly flying up a foot.\nThe murderer was kicked by me again lying on the ground.\nI sat on my butt on his back.\nHe didn’t give up and struggled for his life. But I can let him get away with it.\nI grabbed his hair with one hand and stuck the back of his neck with the other, and with a little force, he gasped.\n“I, I’m a cop!” He came out with this sentence.\n“You are a police officer? I’m still the chief of public security!” I increased the force again.\nBut all of a sudden, I reacted to something in general.\nI deliberately turned my head sideways and looked at his face.\nI froze, he also froze.\nAnd at that moment, the beard with an innocent look on his face, came running across from the railway track.\n“What’s happening?” He shouted and asked, then looking at the one on the ground, he was even more pretending to be surprised, “Brother Shui, why are you here?”\n5\nThe three of us sat around and smoked together. In fact, Ma Sanshui is a pretty decent police officer, but now completely changed the image.\nBird’s nest head, untidy clothes!\nIn fact, when the two of us helped him up, he once let go of the words: “That’s what you old Ge did this time, replaced by the beard, I guarantee to jerk his job!”\nI glanced at the beard. Beard a strong wink to me.\nNever mind, all brothers, the pot to carry!\nI was also once curious, why he came here in the middle of the night to burn paper. Of course, I would not be stupid to think he is a murderer.\nMa Sanshui explained: he came back from overtime to see my paging, it was also the middle of the night. He thought we were resting, considering that we were both too tired recently, and as a result he came here alone.\nThe reason why he burned paper is that he wanted to take advantage of the foggy day to simulate the phenomenon of the crime at that time, to see if he could capture what psychology of the killer.\nI feel in my heart that he is really a good cop.\nSometimes men don’t have to talk much to each other. I patted him on the shoulder.\nOf course, under this pat, and stirred up a burst of dust.\nMa Sanshui’s meaning, since we two also came, we will share the work, here continue to work until dawn.\nBeard and I have no problem.\nIn order to be more efficient, the three of us also divided the area. I am mainly responsible for the east side of the train station.\nWe also agreed to make a whistling sound the more we got to the emergency.\nIt sounds primitive, but we did not bring the walkie-talkie, and only the whistling sound, it is the most penetrating.\nWith less beards for company, I found myself on patrol, often becoming bored, accompanied only by the sound of train whistles entering and leaving the station.\nAfter a few more trips back and forth like this aimlessly, I sat down on the ground to rest for a while.\nThe fog was getting thicker and thicker. In addition to the poor visibility, it also made people feel wet and uncomfortable.\nI pinched myself, as a kind of massage and relaxation, but not long, especially the buttocks have not covered warm it, I faintly heard a cry.\nWailing, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada. Very miserable, it seems to be a woman.\nIn the middle of the night, I was so scared that my hair stood up.\n“Who is playing a prank?” The first thought came to me, and I looked in the direction of the sound coming from.\nAlthough nothing could be seen, but I tasted.\nThen I faintly heard a scream. At this point, even a fool, should also guess what.\nI immediately got up, looking for the sound rushed over. In fact, this moment, I was nervous, but also forgot to send a signal.\nJust a few dozen meters ahead, a black shadow suddenly appeared in front.\nI looked at him through the fog as much as I could, and he was looking at me.\nI felt that the whole heart was in the throat, because I could not tell for a moment, this is a person or a ghost.\nHe was wearing a black robe, estimated to be fur and other materials, so some hairy feeling. In addition, his face is also full of black hair.\nHairy child? I suddenly thought of beard words.\nHe was also carrying a black goo in his hand at the moment, presumably the murder weapon.\nWe both looked at each other in silence for a few seconds, and he tilted his head. I could tell that he was surprised and curious about my appearance.\n“What a pervert!” I cursed in my heart.\nBut then, without waiting for me to do anything about it, he twisted and scattered to escape.\nReally let him retreat into the thick fog, where else could I catch him?\nI therefore chased up.\nIn fact, my legs and feet can still, after all, once joined the swallow door, as a thief. But the evil, I finally in order to stimulate the potential, are hard to pinch their thighs root, but still with the murderer half a catty a chase and escape.\nThe murderer is different from me, while running along the way while flailing. This description is not all right, but that is the feeling, especially under the amplitude of the hands dancing, more to me a feeling that he was flapping his wings.\nWe both followed the railroad tracks from the east side of the train station and came to the station.\nEventually I vaguely saw that he had gotten into a freight car (fire car) with an open door.\nThere were lights and piles of paper boxes of all sizes, as if a small mountain.\nI knew that the killer was hiding here.\nI wiped the sweat from my head and pulled out my trouser belt.\nI also prepared my mind, once I found him, I strangled him to death.\nBut when I passed several piles of paper boxes in turn, there was no gain at all.\n“Hidden deep enough!” I spat in my heart.\nWhat I didn’t expect was that suddenly there was movement in the pile of paper boxes behind myself.\nThe boxes crackled and fell towards me, and a black shadow rushed out from inside.\nHe swung a short-handled hammer, which came down hard on my head.\nThanks to my quick reaction, I raised the belt of my pants to block a little.\nBut he immediately kicked me again.\nFor a moment, I froze. Because this kick is very strange, let me have a kind of vague feeling.\nI don’t know if I was hallucinating, or was there something else going on? But the kick came down, and I also sat on my butt in a pile of boxes.\nThe killer did not continue to attack me, I guess he was also weak at this point.\nHe fled in a flash and escaped. And this lack of virtue, but also very skilled to push the door of the cargo compartment.\nWith a thud, I knew it was going to be bad. But when I rushed to the door, no matter how hard, the door of the cargo compartment did not move ……\nI had to slap the door hard, again to no avail.\nThis is a freight train, at this point also sounded the whistle.\nYou can imagine what my next fate is. I left Valium with the freight car, and started a tragic pattern of day trips abroad ……\n6\nWhen I returned to Valium again, it was already the next day at night.\nThis day, a lot of things happened.\nFirst, a female body was found at the train station. She was over 20 years old, a beautiful-looking pregnant woman, with a fetus of about five months in her belly.\nThe cause of death was 11 blows to the head by the murderer, and a stone hammer to her belly.\nWhat was the scene? The female corpse died on her knees, the head of the fetus actually came out a cut, hanging in the crotch of the female corpse.\nAs for the rest, similar to the previous two murder weapons. In the scene found some scratched matches, the killer also danced, but he did not have time to burn paper, I guess with my then “intrusion” related to it.\nSecondly, everyone thought I was killed, after all, I somehow disappeared, but also missing in action, the dead.\nAt that time, the number of beards cry the most miserable, he also threatened to say that I would rather be sentenced to death, when the time to avenge the old Ge, after catching the murderer, on the spot he died alive!\nBut his words, but also met with Ma Sanshui severe criticism.\nIt is said that the bearded man hid at home for a day of depression, until I suddenly pushed the door, he only ah.\nI do not care whether I am a human being or a ghost, he froze for a few seconds and then suddenly jumped over, all kinds of hugs! I had to stop it in advance, otherwise he would have been excited to kiss me a few times.\nI did not care to rest, overnight to report their encounters to Ma Sanshui.\nBut just report it, not much help to solve the case.\nThe following week, the killer disappeared without a trace. During this week, the train station twice again under the fog, the police also sent a large number of people, to come here to squat, but in vain.\nIn addition, because of the seriousness of the three murders, the matter completely alarmed the upper echelons, the provincial department was outraged.\nThe provincial government issued an important document: within ten days to solve the case, never let the perpetrators go unpunished.\nI can’t describe the scene that followed. The city of Anding simply became a stronghold, the various police forces around the area, are converging here one after another.\nCountless elite police officers, countless experts and eyes and ears, in batches and teams rushed over. The city’s conference room is too small, then directly into the open air meeting, in the backyard full of tables and chairs.\nThe experts brainstormed, once again analyzed and discussed the case.\nAnd the appearance of the third murder case, also let the previous “crime profile” contradictory: the killer’s target, not only the old and weak male, he also surprisingly brutal to young pregnant women.\nBut this is not a big problem, at least the general direction is correct.\nAfter the experts have repeatedly pushed, more perfect and accurate “profile”, but also made out.\nAccording to the new profile, the police continue to increase the investigation.\nIn fact, just listen to the data from the visits, it is enough to explain everything: the police footprint, almost covered the four districts of the city of Anding 18 townships, 108 villages, a total of more than 100,000 people, including workers and farmers investigated.\nAs for the key suspects screened out, there were at most 146 at one time. The police next compressed the key suspects to nine people through various rankings and comparisons. These included a station attendant at the Anding City train station.\nThis person was named Wang Jun, or a steward, and was in charge of the VIP waiting room.\nAt that time, the train stations around the world, VIP waiting room has clear rules: the general public need to pay a fee, often five or ten dollars, you can wait here, or even get on the train early. But in the face of military personnel and pregnant women, and even breastfeeding women, it was completely free.\nThe third victim, who came to the VIP waiting room that night, but Wang Jun various difficulties, resulting in this pregnant woman left, and what happened, she ended up dying a horrible death outside.\nSimilarly, the police investigation found that the first two victims, although not to the VIP waiting room, but the night of the murder, the original Wang Jun was not on duty, but he coincidentally came to the train station, but also appeared on the platform.\nThere was a porter named Yu Yan’an, and also with Wang Jun hair greeting it, but Wang Jun tense face, cold expression, even ignored and Yu Yan’an brushed past.\nAnd the most important, Wang Jun’s many personal data, including age, height, etc., are consistent with the profile of the killer.\nThe police called Wang Jun to the police station several times to talk.\nBut each time down, Wang Jun has a very strong attitude denied.\n“I killed someone? What a joke! Besides, you dare to mess around and try? My uncle is the station manager of the train station!” This was the sentence he replied to the most.\nI don’t know what this guy was thinking, why did he bring out his uncle, is it possible to use his uncle to give himself courage?\nIn this way, the deadline is getting closer and closer, until the tenth day, when the police department was overwhelmed by the enormous pressure to solve the case, someone reported that a neighbor was found in his home suicide.\nThe police temporarily sent two people to the scene, but soon, these two people came back with a fierce news: the deceased is Wang Jun! And he committed suicide in fear of crime!\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>&ldquo;Murder is sacred&rdquo;: he is the only criminal with the word &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; in his criminal file! Killing is ritualistic!</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;Why does everyone tell me that I can&rsquo;t stay longer at the train station?&rdquo; This is a question that many people have asked.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say an answer in my mind: because it is haunted and murderous!</p>
<p>This is also a real event that happened many years ago.</p>
<p>Putting aside the superstition, it is really haunted! This is the only murder case in the country&rsquo;s criminal records that has the word &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; in it.</p>
<p>How spooky is it? The ghost came down from the sky and floated away after killing; how cruel and bizarre is the method? Cruel to look at the corpse, the professionals were scared not to speak; bizarre to the local police held a case analysis meeting, but the whole confused!</p>
<p>At that time, a train station in Shaanxi once became a forbidden place, so many people stop!</p>
<p>If you are interested, I, as a personal experience, will write about what happened at the time, to restore it perfectly.</p>
<p>But also a reminder: resistance to stress is small, please stop here, because the next part of the scene, will cause all kinds of discomfort.</p>
<p>March 3, 1994</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with this day. In the early morning after the fog, we were standing in front of some roadbed berm on the northwest side of the train station in the city of Valium.</p>
<p>Everyone looked bad, no one was talking, and the atmosphere was cold. Only the forensic scientist squatted in front of the body, doing various examinations.</p>
<p>This is an elderly male corpse, naked, tied hands, kneeling on the ground, making an atonement-like kowtow.</p>
<p>His clothes, all neatly folded aside, but only missing the autumn pants. Because the pants were put on his head.</p>
<p>Obviously, the murderer intended to do it.</p>
<p>Forensics also lifted the pants, but that moment, the people who saw all revolted.</p>
<p>The whole face of the deceased was a bit collapsed, especially on the brain shell, it was simply a pit after another pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A total of 11 contusions (blunt force trauma caused by fracture type), each fatal!&rdquo; The coroner said to us.</p>
<p>That sounded contradictory. I thought to myself: if each of them could kill a person, why did the killer hit him eleven times? And if the body had been stripped naked, why did he cover his head again?</p>
<p>And the murder scene.</p>
<p>Not far from the body, there is a burned paper circles. It was drawn with a tree branch.</p>
<p>My guess is that after the murder, the killer just burned the paper at the murder scene. But what was the purpose? A sacrifice to someone?</p>
<p>In addition, the scene did not leave much blood, which is also directly related to the murder weapon. I guess the murder weapon is a hammer, with this thing to hit the head, to vulgarity, are internal injuries.</p>
<p>Next to the burned paper circle, in addition to scattered scratched matches, but also distributed a large number and disorderly footprints.</p>
<p>I looked at them in comparison, not the deceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the killer do at that time?&rdquo; I am full of question marks. Incidentally, I observed these footprints, especially focus on picking out a few to try to simulate themselves, to see how can also step out of a similar track.</p>
<p>Finally, I came up with a ridiculous idea: he was dancing!</p>
<p>Imagine the scene: the hot corpse kneeling here, the killer and a fire with coins, and then, he danced in the firelight!</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself. I was a special professional in the nineties - the grey eyes and ears of special cases, which is also the predecessor of 321 (criminal special intelligence).</p>
<p>The people who came here know that the era of the big cases and important cases more, the police force is seriously inadequate, and like me a slight skill of the released prisoners, was &ldquo;recruited&rdquo; to become a force like a supporting force.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to this case.</p>
<p>In the morning, the large conference room of the Public Security Bureau of Stabilization City was filled with smoke.</p>
<p>The participants all had serious faces. It is not an exaggeration to say that everyone was confused.</p>
<p>This is the second murder case in a row in the last week. The modus operandi was almost identical.</p>
<p>The victims were both elderly males. One was 56 years old, one was 52 years old, and both were found with unchecked tickets in their belongings, thus judging that both were passengers. Also no cash was found.</p>
<p>In response to the two murders, there are differing views within the police.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the killer is a pure pervert, the elderly and infirm men as the target, essentially robbing the main; but others believe that this is a typical case of revenge killing, the 11 thwarted trauma, is a manifestation of the abuse of the body to vent their anger.</p>
<p>Of course, my partner beard and I, once a prison oil (prison head prison bully), and did not participate in the whole meeting. Later, the two of us, with the upper line (detective) Ma Sanshui together to hide in the next room.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui smoked one cigarette after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared!&rdquo; He suddenly opened his mouth and came out with this sentence.</p>
<p>Beard and I looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Shui, you are an old bird who has seen the storm, this case, and only two people died, what is the fear?&rdquo; Beard said, and gave Ma Sanshui a cigarette refill.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui very serious stare at us both: &ldquo;This has nothing to do with how many people died! In other cases, even if more people died, but as long as the crime scene, I can more or less understand the psychology of the killer, but this time, which of you can tell me, the killer in the end what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The table was originally bashed with a pile of information, all about the dead.</p>
<p>He deliberately pushed the information toward us. &ldquo;A revenge killing? The two dead, a stuttering welder, a crippled peddler selling kang buns (sesame cakes), what juxtaposition do they have? As for the robbery, where there are such robbers? Dedicated to robbing the poor, but also burn paper and dance to celebrate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beard and I did not know how to answer.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui took a few more puffs of muffled smoke, a change of topic: &ldquo;At present, this is also a serial murder case. This kind of serial cases, there is often a cooling-off period, but the 2nd 28th kill a person, today March 3, another dead. It&rsquo;s too fast! And so far, we don&rsquo;t even have any information about the killer, as it is &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He a sigh.</p>
<p>Beard seemed to think of something and rubbed his hands, &ldquo;Brother Shui, we may have information on the killer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Ma Sanshui asked.</p>
<p>Beard mentioned a word: &ldquo;Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I understood what the beard meant. More than a month ago, more than one passenger responded that the Anding train station was haunted at night.</p>
<p>In fact, in those days, haunted things often, but mainly blackmail.</p>
<p>The ghost of the station alone, the police also sent people to investigate, collected information on this, and eventually, according to the information, to make a sketch of it.</p>
<p>Beard and I have seen. The first feeling, called the ghost is okay, or called the goblin is also okay. Anyway, it is covered with furry.</p>
<p>Beard even gave it a nickname: Hairy Boy!</p>
<p>I guess, the beard is to remind Ma Sanshui, the ghost could be the murderer pretending to be it?</p>
<p>But then, the mystery is more, the killer impersonated it to do what?</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui heard the beard&rsquo;s reminder, the first reaction was to say back: &ldquo;Bullshit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he is not like other police officers, not so dead brain.</p>
<p>Wait and silently pondered some more. He ordered: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this, you two go to verify the matter again. Remember, everything must be based on facts, bite the right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, while the two of us launched an investigation, the police also had action.</p>
<p>Especially according to several discussions and analysis, combined with the scene left shoe prints and other features, the police to the criminals made a &ldquo;profile&rdquo;: male perpetrators, aged 20-35 years old, about 1.7 meters tall, carrying a short-handled masonry hammer, withdrawn and introverted personality, psychological disorders, good alone activities or single living alone. Familiar with the situation of Anding station, in Anding has a fixed residence.</p>
<p>Of course, at the bottom of this &ldquo;profile&rdquo; description, there is a note: the perpetrator is likely to have only a junior high school education, may also have been dealt with by the public security organs, and economic difficulties, waiting for money.</p>
<p>I know that &ldquo;profiling&rdquo; is very profound, almost all the criminal investigation professional things. As the eyes and ears, I once tried to backtrack, wondering what the police are based on to reach these conclusions. But finally gave up. The difficulty is too great.</p>
<p>The police have been using &ldquo;profiling&rdquo; as a basis, and almost all of them are out there. The police were almost all over the place, centered on the station, and started a search in a three-kilometer radius. I remember when everyone was shouting slogans: task to group, responsibility to the person. Whether in the road, urban, rural, as long as in the lock area, all do not let go.</p>
<p>For a while, the beard and I even dare not open the walkie-talkie, because both the main frequency or alternative channels, it is simply a cacophony of people, chaos and a pot of porridge.</p>
<p>Everyone either asked each other about the progress, or someone reported that he had found the suspect.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, the beard and I took advantage of a handful, after all, we two are not so strong, just simply to investigate the ghost matter.</p>
<p>Originally, I also intended to strictly follow the implementation of what Ma Sanshui said, the ghost incident in the factual basis for the full collection of things over, but in fact, I found that simply can not do.</p>
<p>A person in the know: the night he rode in the car, he did see a ghost! The ghost fanned its wings, furry and descended from the sky, and after a face-to-face meeting with him, it fanned its wings and flew into the foggy night.</p>
<p>Another informant was even more outrageous, he insisted: the ghost appeared in the blink of an eye, and in the blink of an eye, it disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>I did not say anything at the time. The bearded man, once anxious, questioned those in the know: &ldquo;Flying into the sky? Suddenly appear and disappear? Damn, your heads are not farted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to my mediation, otherwise these people in the know really want to go to Ma Sanshui that a complaint, saying that the beard rude and so on, it is estimated that he will have to be locked up for a few days.</p>
<p>This wavered to two days later in the evening, the beard and I returned to the residence.</p>
<p>We both ate boxed meals, bearded originally and I chatted, but I tend to slip, the heart still thinking about the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Ge, off duty! Relax, let&rsquo;s talk about the big girl is good?&rdquo; He interrupted me again this time.</p>
<p>Then he pointed out the window: &ldquo;You say this foggy day, those big girls are hiding at home why? Wouldn&rsquo;t they also be thinking about handsome guys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My brain like a sudden electric current, and even a jolt, hands loose, chopsticks are dropped on the floor.</p>
<p>The bearded man shushed me: &ldquo;Talking about the big girl, look how excited you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to help me pick up the chopsticks.</p>
<p>But I grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>He was startled: &ldquo;What are you doing? Look at your thieving eyes, remind you, I&rsquo;m a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misty! Misty!&rdquo; I was in a hurry, I could only pop out one word at a time.</p>
<p>See the beard still look confused, I swallowed hard, and reminded: &ldquo;What happened the night of the two murders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fog ah!&rdquo; Beard replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then think again, when we investigate ghosts, those in the know said that the night of the ghosts, what was the weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fog! Fog fog!&rdquo; Beard slowed down after half a beat, read aloud and repeatedly, but do not forget that he is still eating. The result caused my face a moment sticky a lot of rice grains.</p>
<p>I could not care less about this, after wiping casually, also pointed out the window: &ldquo;Tonight there is fog! And big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>March 6, 1994</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about geography and meteorology, but in the city of Valium, every late winter/early spring season, there is frequent fog at night.</p>
<p>The beard and I discussed some more, and both agreed: the killer likes to be out in the foggy days. Although the specific reason is still unknown, but if we really guessed right, this night will be a focus.</p>
<p>At that time there was no cell phone, and even only the models deserve to have a big brother. I in order to report this guess to Ma Sanshui in a timely manner, it continuously paged him (BB), and even gave him a Han Hsien reminder: fog!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he never called back.</p>
<p>I discussed with the beard, so we both went to the train station overnight.</p>
<p>Only one purpose: patrol, to prevent further tragedies.</p>
<p>Also take into account the night is too cold, we both in addition to wrapped in a thick cotton jacket, also each wearing a dogskin hat.</p>
<p>That shape, think about it, even if the more serious people, wearing it, are a bit of a blind man&rsquo;s feeling.</p>
<p>I remember that the two murders happened between two and four in the morning, so I pinpointed the time, just after two, we both walked back and forth along the platform.</p>
<p>Also because we are very tired during the day, and now the night and back-to-back, the beard eventually some can not stay up, once with me spit: &ldquo;Almost have to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that when we go back, the killer will appear again in time!&rdquo; I said my fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such coincidence!&rdquo; He waved a big hand.</p>
<p>But soon, when the two of us out of the station, out of the northwest side of another large, not to mention him, even my eyes widened.</p>
<p>There was the firelight! In the night fog, it was hazy, but also very conspicuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning, burning paper?&rdquo; Beard chanted.</p>
<p>I did not answer him positively.</p>
<p>At this moment I have a deer in my heart, it crashes around a lot.</p>
<p>I gestured to the beard, afraid to talk now delay.</p>
<p>I mean: go to the other of the tracks, under the cover of the slope, we sneak past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chore! Because we have to walk the duck walk. That is, the kind of half-crouching walk.</p>
<p>Do not look at the short distance of one hundred and eighty meters, and finally my crotch shaft are sore, but wait to lie down on the tracks, and then so close to observe, there is indeed someone burning paper, he is also wearing a black trench coat, in addition he is also dancing weird.</p>
<p>Beard and I are pressed, I deliberately and carefully look for some, no body found.</p>
<p>So, he was burning paper and dancing before bringing people here to kill? I thought.</p>
<p>After another ten seconds or so, the beard can not sink.</p>
<p>This kid is, after all, the prison oil origin, the hands of no one. He bowed, like a leopard, and so noiselessly stepped over the tracks, he suddenly spring up like a spring and pounced.</p>
<p>A hungry tiger pounced on him. The man grunted miserably, the face rushed down by the beard sat on the ground.</p>
<p>I was thinking, how to play next to help themselves? But the beard eeked, then even jumped up, playing a life to escape to my side.</p>
<p>I completely froze, thinking that in the end what happened?</p>
<p>Beard came back and pushed me hard, that means, you rushed!</p>
<p>Looking at the killer immediately stood up, I put aside all distracting thoughts.</p>
<p>I do not beard that move, so after rushing over, directly flying up a foot.</p>
<p>The murderer was kicked by me again lying on the ground.</p>
<p>I sat on my butt on his back.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t give up and struggled for his life. But I can let him get away with it.</p>
<p>I grabbed his hair with one hand and stuck the back of his neck with the other, and with a little force, he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I&rsquo;m a cop!&rdquo; He came out with this sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a police officer? I&rsquo;m still the chief of public security!&rdquo; I increased the force again.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden, I reacted to something in general.</p>
<p>I deliberately turned my head sideways and looked at his face.</p>
<p>I froze, he also froze.</p>
<p>And at that moment, the beard with an innocent look on his face, came running across from the railway track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; He shouted and asked, then looking at the one on the ground, he was even more pretending to be surprised, &ldquo;Brother Shui, why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The three of us sat around and smoked together. In fact, Ma Sanshui is a pretty decent police officer, but now completely changed the image.</p>
<p>Bird&rsquo;s nest head, untidy clothes!</p>
<p>In fact, when the two of us helped him up, he once let go of the words: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you old Ge did this time, replaced by the beard, I guarantee to jerk his job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the beard. Beard a strong wink to me.</p>
<p>Never mind, all brothers, the pot to carry!</p>
<p>I was also once curious, why he came here in the middle of the night to burn paper. Of course, I would not be stupid to think he is a murderer.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui explained: he came back from overtime to see my paging, it was also the middle of the night. He thought we were resting, considering that we were both too tired recently, and as a result he came here alone.</p>
<p>The reason why he burned paper is that he wanted to take advantage of the foggy day to simulate the phenomenon of the crime at that time, to see if he could capture what psychology of the killer.</p>
<p>I feel in my heart that he is really a good cop.</p>
<p>Sometimes men don&rsquo;t have to talk much to each other. I patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Of course, under this pat, and stirred up a burst of dust.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui&rsquo;s meaning, since we two also came, we will share the work, here continue to work until dawn.</p>
<p>Beard and I have no problem.</p>
<p>In order to be more efficient, the three of us also divided the area. I am mainly responsible for the east side of the train station.</p>
<p>We also agreed to make a whistling sound the more we got to the emergency.</p>
<p>It sounds primitive, but we did not bring the walkie-talkie, and only the whistling sound, it is the most penetrating.</p>
<p>With less beards for company, I found myself on patrol, often becoming bored, accompanied only by the sound of train whistles entering and leaving the station.</p>
<p>After a few more trips back and forth like this aimlessly, I sat down on the ground to rest for a while.</p>
<p>The fog was getting thicker and thicker. In addition to the poor visibility, it also made people feel wet and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I pinched myself, as a kind of massage and relaxation, but not long, especially the buttocks have not covered warm it, I faintly heard a cry.</p>
<p>Wailing, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada. Very miserable, it seems to be a woman.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I was so scared that my hair stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is playing a prank?&rdquo; The first thought came to me, and I looked in the direction of the sound coming from.</p>
<p>Although nothing could be seen, but I tasted.</p>
<p>Then I faintly heard a scream. At this point, even a fool, should also guess what.</p>
<p>I immediately got up, looking for the sound rushed over. In fact, this moment, I was nervous, but also forgot to send a signal.</p>
<p>Just a few dozen meters ahead, a black shadow suddenly appeared in front.</p>
<p>I looked at him through the fog as much as I could, and he was looking at me.</p>
<p>I felt that the whole heart was in the throat, because I could not tell for a moment, this is a person or a ghost.</p>
<p>He was wearing a black robe, estimated to be fur and other materials, so some hairy feeling. In addition, his face is also full of black hair.</p>
<p>Hairy child? I suddenly thought of beard words.</p>
<p>He was also carrying a black goo in his hand at the moment, presumably the murder weapon.</p>
<p>We both looked at each other in silence for a few seconds, and he tilted his head. I could tell that he was surprised and curious about my appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pervert!&rdquo; I cursed in my heart.</p>
<p>But then, without waiting for me to do anything about it, he twisted and scattered to escape.</p>
<p>Really let him retreat into the thick fog, where else could I catch him?</p>
<p>I therefore chased up.</p>
<p>In fact, my legs and feet can still, after all, once joined the swallow door, as a thief. But the evil, I finally in order to stimulate the potential, are hard to pinch their thighs root, but still with the murderer half a catty a chase and escape.</p>
<p>The murderer is different from me, while running along the way while flailing. This description is not all right, but that is the feeling, especially under the amplitude of the hands dancing, more to me a feeling that he was flapping his wings.</p>
<p>We both followed the railroad tracks from the east side of the train station and came to the station.</p>
<p>Eventually I vaguely saw that he had gotten into a freight car (fire car) with an open door.</p>
<p>There were lights and piles of paper boxes of all sizes, as if a small mountain.</p>
<p>I knew that the killer was hiding here.</p>
<p>I wiped the sweat from my head and pulled out my trouser belt.</p>
<p>I also prepared my mind, once I found him, I strangled him to death.</p>
<p>But when I passed several piles of paper boxes in turn, there was no gain at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidden deep enough!&rdquo; I spat in my heart.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect was that suddenly there was movement in the pile of paper boxes behind myself.</p>
<p>The boxes crackled and fell towards me, and a black shadow rushed out from inside.</p>
<p>He swung a short-handled hammer, which came down hard on my head.</p>
<p>Thanks to my quick reaction, I raised the belt of my pants to block a little.</p>
<p>But he immediately kicked me again.</p>
<p>For a moment, I froze. Because this kick is very strange, let me have a kind of vague feeling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I was hallucinating, or was there something else going on? But the kick came down, and I also sat on my butt in a pile of boxes.</p>
<p>The killer did not continue to attack me, I guess he was also weak at this point.</p>
<p>He fled in a flash and escaped. And this lack of virtue, but also very skilled to push the door of the cargo compartment.</p>
<p>With a thud, I knew it was going to be bad. But when I rushed to the door, no matter how hard, the door of the cargo compartment did not move &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I had to slap the door hard, again to no avail.</p>
<p>This is a freight train, at this point also sounded the whistle.</p>
<p>You can imagine what my next fate is. I left Valium with the freight car, and started a tragic pattern of day trips abroad &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>When I returned to Valium again, it was already the next day at night.</p>
<p>This day, a lot of things happened.</p>
<p>First, a female body was found at the train station. She was over 20 years old, a beautiful-looking pregnant woman, with a fetus of about five months in her belly.</p>
<p>The cause of death was 11 blows to the head by the murderer, and a stone hammer to her belly.</p>
<p>What was the scene? The female corpse died on her knees, the head of the fetus actually came out a cut, hanging in the crotch of the female corpse.</p>
<p>As for the rest, similar to the previous two murder weapons. In the scene found some scratched matches, the killer also danced, but he did not have time to burn paper, I guess with my then &ldquo;intrusion&rdquo; related to it.</p>
<p>Secondly, everyone thought I was killed, after all, I somehow disappeared, but also missing in action, the dead.</p>
<p>At that time, the number of beards cry the most miserable, he also threatened to say that I would rather be sentenced to death, when the time to avenge the old Ge, after catching the murderer, on the spot he died alive!</p>
<p>But his words, but also met with Ma Sanshui severe criticism.</p>
<p>It is said that the bearded man hid at home for a day of depression, until I suddenly pushed the door, he only ah.</p>
<p>I do not care whether I am a human being or a ghost, he froze for a few seconds and then suddenly jumped over, all kinds of hugs! I had to stop it in advance, otherwise he would have been excited to kiss me a few times.</p>
<p>I did not care to rest, overnight to report their encounters to Ma Sanshui.</p>
<p>But just report it, not much help to solve the case.</p>
<p>The following week, the killer disappeared without a trace. During this week, the train station twice again under the fog, the police also sent a large number of people, to come here to squat, but in vain.</p>
<p>In addition, because of the seriousness of the three murders, the matter completely alarmed the upper echelons, the provincial department was outraged.</p>
<p>The provincial government issued an important document: within ten days to solve the case, never let the perpetrators go unpunished.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t describe the scene that followed. The city of Anding simply became a stronghold, the various police forces around the area, are converging here one after another.</p>
<p>Countless elite police officers, countless experts and eyes and ears, in batches and teams rushed over. The city&rsquo;s conference room is too small, then directly into the open air meeting, in the backyard full of tables and chairs.</p>
<p>The experts brainstormed, once again analyzed and discussed the case.</p>
<p>And the appearance of the third murder case, also let the previous &ldquo;crime profile&rdquo; contradictory: the killer&rsquo;s target, not only the old and weak male, he also surprisingly brutal to young pregnant women.</p>
<p>But this is not a big problem, at least the general direction is correct.</p>
<p>After the experts have repeatedly pushed, more perfect and accurate &ldquo;profile&rdquo;, but also made out.</p>
<p>According to the new profile, the police continue to increase the investigation.</p>
<p>In fact, just listen to the data from the visits, it is enough to explain everything: the police footprint, almost covered the four districts of the city of Anding 18 townships, 108 villages, a total of more than 100,000 people, including workers and farmers investigated.</p>
<p>As for the key suspects screened out, there were at most 146 at one time. The police next compressed the key suspects to nine people through various rankings and comparisons. These included a station attendant at the Anding City train station.</p>
<p>This person was named Wang Jun, or a steward, and was in charge of the VIP waiting room.</p>
<p>At that time, the train stations around the world, VIP waiting room has clear rules: the general public need to pay a fee, often five or ten dollars, you can wait here, or even get on the train early. But in the face of military personnel and pregnant women, and even breastfeeding women, it was completely free.</p>
<p>The third victim, who came to the VIP waiting room that night, but Wang Jun various difficulties, resulting in this pregnant woman left, and what happened, she ended up dying a horrible death outside.</p>
<p>Similarly, the police investigation found that the first two victims, although not to the VIP waiting room, but the night of the murder, the original Wang Jun was not on duty, but he coincidentally came to the train station, but also appeared on the platform.</p>
<p>There was a porter named Yu Yan&rsquo;an, and also with Wang Jun hair greeting it, but Wang Jun tense face, cold expression, even ignored and Yu Yan&rsquo;an brushed past.</p>
<p>And the most important, Wang Jun&rsquo;s many personal data, including age, height, etc., are consistent with the profile of the killer.</p>
<p>The police called Wang Jun to the police station several times to talk.</p>
<p>But each time down, Wang Jun has a very strong attitude denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I killed someone? What a joke! Besides, you dare to mess around and try? My uncle is the station manager of the train station!&rdquo; This was the sentence he replied to the most.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what this guy was thinking, why did he bring out his uncle, is it possible to use his uncle to give himself courage?</p>
<p>In this way, the deadline is getting closer and closer, until the tenth day, when the police department was overwhelmed by the enormous pressure to solve the case, someone reported that a neighbor was found in his home suicide.</p>
<p>The police temporarily sent two people to the scene, but soon, these two people came back with a fierce news: the deceased is Wang Jun! And he committed suicide in fear of crime!</p>
