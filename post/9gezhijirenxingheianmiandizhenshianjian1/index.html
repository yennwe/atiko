This family is dying!”\n“It’s a big case of human lives, let’s go!\nThe police immediately dispatched a team and found the body of Kazuko Oe, a 66-year-old woman who had been missing for a long time, in a barrel filled with cement in a rented warehouse, according to the location reported by a neighbor.\nHomicide cases are not rare in Amagasaki City, but they are common in Japan.\nThe police thought it was just an ordinary murder case and were going to visit the victim’s family, but only when they went there did they realize something was wrong.\nThe family was almost “exterminated”, and Kazuko Oe was brutally murdered and abused by her family.\nThe police were horrified, and as they investigated deeper, they found that the murderer of Kazuko Oe was not the murderer, but all six members of the Oe family were victims.\nThe most suspected murderer was actually a stranger who had nothing to do with it - a 64-year-old woman named Miyoko Kakuta!\nHow in the world did this old woman do it?\nHow could a good family kill each other?\nAs the police investigate, a 25-year old serial manipulation murder case emerges.\nSeven families were completely wiped out, eight people died and three were missing.\nWives and daughters turned against each other, relatives abused and killed each other, and not only meekly surrendered their property and houses, but also obeyed the killer.\nMiyoko Kakuta, who never did anything herself, got everything by manipulating the knife and killing people.\nThis is the most bizarre mass murder case in Japanese history - the Amagasaki murder dead body abandonment case.\nThe question is, how did she, with her thin figure and 64 years of age, destroy so many families? ,\n01\n“A body poured with cement”\nThis was Miyoko Kakuta’s last case before her arrest, and the one that best demonstrates her ability to charm people.\nAfter looking up a lot of information, I will show you how Miyoko Kakuta destroyed her family step by step, harvested her property, and killed people with a knife.\nAfter sorting out the case information, in addition to lamenting the fragility of human nature, I also had to admit that Miyoko’s methods are so high, the criminal psychological complexity.\nThis case is very top, after reading it, I believe you will have a better understanding of human nature.\nThe last victim is the 66-year-old woman mentioned at the beginning, Kazuko Oe.\nAn investigating police officer lamented, “If the Oe family, had not met her, perhaps they would have grown old peacefully and happily.”\nBut fate is always strange, you can’t predict which time and strangers crossed paths, will make their own destruction.\nThe Oe family is a very ordinary working family, a family of six people live on the land under the name of Kazuko Oe, Kazuko Oe is the only old man in the family, the second daughter Yumi and son-in-law Hiroyuki Kawamura have two daughters in elementary school, the eldest daughter Kaede is not yet married, the family life is ordinary and happy.\nIn 2003, the Oe family decided to refurbish the old house for Kazuko’s old age, so they built a small three-story building in the name of their son-in-law Kawamura.\n(Oe’s family chart)\nOne day in April 2009.\nKawamura, who was going to work on the Hankyu subway as usual, suddenly heard a cry of alarm from the carriage.\nKawamura rushed over and pulled the stuck stroller and the anxious Miyoko out of danger just as the doors were about to close.\n“This is a life saver, please be sure to come to my house and I will thank you personally!\nKawamura waved his hand in embarrassment, thinking it was his duty.\nBut Miyoko was very sincere, so Kawamura went to Miyoko’s house as a guest, unable to resist the warm invitation.\nAt this time, Kawamura did not realize that this would be the beginning of his future misfortune.\nWith the unique amiability and social skills of an older person, Miyoko and Kawamura then maintained a pleasant relationship.\n“It was a big deal to save the baby’s life, so I can’t thank her enough!\nWith Miyoko’s enthusiasm, Kawamura was invited to her home at least 20 times, and the two of them gradually talked like friends, and Kawamura’s work-related matters were gradually revealed to Miyoko.\nMiyoko had a plan in mind.\nOn the grounds that the subway was mismanaged and caused the passenger’s baby to be caught, she filed a request for compensation with Kawamura’s workplace, Hankyu Subway.\nWith her justifiable reason, and Miyoko’s attitude of making a big deal out of it, Kawamura and her supervisor had a big headache.\nThe supervisor agreed to pay 30,000 yen in the name of the company, but Miyoko, who saw the possibility of the matter, immediately used a threatening tone and offered to pay 200,000 yen herself.\n“Think it over, or I’ll make a scene and let your company executives know!\nThe timid Kawamura wanted to settle the matter and gave Miyoko a promise under the disapproving gaze of her boss.\n“I really can’t get 200,000, so I’ll pay you 180,000 yen and give you 90,000 yen each time.\nLike most people, Kawamura, who just wanted to settle the matter privately, was the perfect prey in Miyoko’s eyes.\nMiyoko knew that Kawamura would definitely be cold to her if she made such a fuss, so in order to bring her closer, she explained her reasons for doing so to the Kawamura couple at the dinner table under the guise of treating them to dinner.\nThe Kawamura couple also had two daughters, and as they were both parents, they could understand each other’s feelings, and the three of them ate happily.\nMiyoko, who had great social skills, used her magic charm and conversation to quickly win the Kawamura couple’s favor, and they remained friends for the next eight months.\nBut, it was just the calm before the storm. Miyoko was like a snake, waiting for an opportunity to move and had great patience with her prey.\nThe year-long friendship made the Kawamura couple lose their wariness of Miyoko.\nKawamura also used to go to Miyoko after work to talk, and occasionally would spill his family and workplace grievances to Miyoko, who gently expressed her understanding and enlightened him, while silently calculating in her mind.\n“What a poor guy, let’s start with him”.\nMiyoko then found a suitable opportunity to lend Kawamura 20,000 yen, without mentioning anything about paying him back, and said she would like to invite the Kawamura couple to dinner.\nAfter that, Miyoko and the Kawamura couple often get together on weekends, and Miyoko pays for all the meals, and never mentions AA, so that the Kawamura couple acquiesces that they treat themselves every time.\nIn the process of getting along, Miyoko conquered the Kawamura couple with her personal charm, and her goodwill level was already full.\nSeeing that the time had come, Miyoko started the first round of action.\nShe calculated the meal cost for several meals and determined that the amount was so huge that the other party could not afford it, so she asked the Kawamura couple for the previous loan and AA meal cost, knowing that the other party would not refuse her request because they were embarrassed.\nThe status of the Kawamura couple and Miyoko changed. The guilty Kawamura couple could not get that much money at once, so they had to apologize to Miyoko on their knees in the park, and Miyoko took this opportunity to punch and kick the Kawamura couple, expressing her disappointment in their family.\nShe also persuaded Kawamura to quit his unprofitable job and leave the troublesome family that was asking him to spend money everywhere.\nEven though Miyoko has gone too far, Kawamura and his wife are in the wrong, so they have to swallow their anger.\nWhen Kawamura’s idea of opening a cafe comes to her attention, Miyoko promises Kawamura.\n“Go ahead, I’ll take care of the land! I’ll take care of the land! Don’t be a big man and make a decision!”\nAs a matter of fact, Kawamura went home and told his wife that he was going to quit his iron job and open a cafe to make a lot of money.\nHis wife thought he was out of his mind and that he couldn’t take such a risk with two daughters at home.\nKawamura’s relationship with his wife gets worse and worse, and he goes to Miyoko after work to talk about his troubles.\nSeeing that the couple’s relationship is hardened, Miyoko seizes this opportunity to further lead Kawamura to resent his family.\n“Leave that woman who doesn’t support you! You two don’t fit! \"\nMiyoko was really good at PUA, so she soothed Kawamura’s heart with her perfect lover status while fanning the flames for him to quit his job.\nIn April 2010, Kawamura resigned from his 20-year old job and bet the rest of his life on Miyoko.\nThe happy Kawamura must not have thought that his life was about to be ruined by meeting someone unlucky and not knowing people well.\nTo celebrate his departure, Miyoko gave Kawamura a batch of high-class coffee tableware, so Kawamura was full of gratitude.\nOn one side is not understand also complained about your wife, the other side is to support your dream of the perfect lover, if it were you, how would you choose?\nThe answer is obvious.\nKawamura was completely charmed by Miyoko, and he gave her all the 9 million yen from his company’s severance package, the millions of yen from his loan, and even the property in his name to open a cafe.\nWith her huge fortune, Miyoko happily moves into Kawamura’s house and starts living with Kazuko Oe’s family.\nMiyoko’s ambition was much more than that, she wanted to squeeze everyone dry!\nSo Miyoko’s family-destroying drama, which Miyoko had already succeeded countless times, was staged in Oe’s house.\nAfter watching Miyoko’s plan, I speculated that she herself must have excellent psychological insight, excellent social skills, know how to interrogate prisoners, and know very well the dark side of human nature, clean and crisp, extremely high psychological quality, as if hammered hundreds of times as skilled.\nThe first step of Miyoko’s plan: to divest the opponents.\nThe first step is to turn the young couple against each other and pry the family relationship from the children.\nMiyoko was so uncomfortable with her opinionated wife, Yumi, that for over a year, she secretly instilled in Kawamura’s two daughters the idea that Yumi was not a good mother, and the daughters, of course, preferred the soft-spoken Miyoko to their strict mother.\nTaking advantage of her lover’s advantage, she also kept filling Kawamura’s wife with bad words. Miyoko, who had taken the dominant position in the family, called everyone up for a family meeting to discuss the Kawamura couple’s divorce.\nThe two daughters, already dissatisfied with their mother, watch the drama while expressing their desire for Miyoko to be the mother.\nMiyoko then forces her wife, Yumi, to give up custody and divorce Kawamura.\nTaking control of the family’s finances is like choking a snake by the seventh inch. In order to pacify the meaningless resistance, Miyoko called her cousin Lee Masanori (an accessory, later arrested), who was in his 30s, strong and grew up admiring the Japanese yakuza, to help Miyoko control the family with violence.\nNormally, if the robbery was purely financial, Miyoko, who had already taken the family’s property, should have stopped.\nGreed for money is only Miyoko’s surface motive, what she really wants is much more than that.\nWhat she wants is an experiment, a sadistic drama called humanity.\nWith the power of the yakuza, the six members of Oe’s family no longer dared to resist.\nMiyoko skilfully treats the family like criminals, strictly controlling everyone’s diet, work and rest, and even going to the bathroom for up to 16 hours a day requires her consent.\nMentally controlled + violently assisted, almost no one could withstand this double oppression.\nAlthough his wife, Yumi, divorced Kawamura, she was still trapped in the house by Miyoko. His sister, Kaiai, the only one who had contact with the outside world, was blackmailed by Miyoko with her family and had no choice but to turn her back on her fiancé and leave the company.\nSince then, the family has been completely cut off from the outside world and has no income, living only on Miyoko’s watch.\nMiyoko uses the experience she has gained in the first half of her life to further deepen the family’s conflict.\nThe second step of the plan: the collapse of trust.\nMiyoko begins her experiment with human nature, dismantling the family’s seemingly unbreakable bonds of trust.\nDisintegrating love, disintegrating kinship, she seems to be verifying something.\nHow exactly does she turn a family that has lived for over a decade against each other in an instant?\nThe tactics are simple and brutal: if you don’t listen, beat, beat until you listen.\nMiyoko asked her wife, Yumi, to abuse her two children in front of the family, and when Yumi did not agree, she was frantically beaten.\nAfter the wife agreed, Miyoko ridiculed the two children for their mother’s greed and fear of death, and the two children came to resent their mother even more.\nThe erratic Miyoko suddenly slapped Yumi in a rage, announcing to the family that only she had the right to beat anyone.\nThe family, shocked by Miyoko’s extreme character, trembled and did not dare to provoke her anger.\nMiyoko, who knew that the only way to break up the family was from within, encouraged everyone to rat on them, but anyone who was accused would be severely beaten, and for a while everyone was cautiously staring at each other.\nMiyoko knows human nature well, and she wants to subliminally influence the family so that they are completely enslaved and target each other.\nIn April 2011, the first person to be domesticated appeared.\nKawamura, who was already in a recent relationship with Miyoko and had maintained an affair, awakened the violent factor in his body after being disciplined by Miyoko.\nKawamura always believed that he was different in Miyoko’s mind, and he wanted to prove to Miyoko that he was trustworthy.\nThe family under strict guard is beaten up even when they doze off. Miyoko finds out that her wife has secretly hidden a piece of chocolate and angrily beats her up. When Kawamura sees this, he joins in the beating to show his loyalty.\nPunch after punch was thrown at his wife, shouting.\n“Hiromi, just die trying to resist! Listen to Miyoko!”\nMiyoko was fanning the flames.\n“You can’t do that, use your strength!”\nKawamura beat his wife even harder, shattering her expectations, and the bond between them was gone.\nKawamura, who has become Miyoko’s right-hand man, has changed from being the ward of the family to being the ward of the family.\nThe family’s initial determination to secretly plan resistance and the relationship of trust with each other gradually disappears.\nIf there was any possibility of resistance in the family before, it has now become Miyoko’s plaything.\nThe most brutal part of Miyoko’s character was completely exposed.\nThe third step of the plan: slavery stimulation.\nThe Oe family, who had been abused for a long time, gradually developed a Stockholm mentality. Miyoko saw the beginnings and made her violent control even harsher, knowing that she was close to success.\nMiyoko began to make everyone reflect on their mistakes by writing them down and reading them to them in violent detention, and then putting them in a small dark room where they were beaten with a special “punishment stick” that left them bloodied and disfigured. In addition, Miyoko degrades their self-esteem, bringing the Oe family to the brink of a nervous breakdown.\nMiyoko was so satisfied that the pleasure of controlling people’s personalities was the greatest pleasure she had gained in the first half of her life.\nJust 2 years after Miyoko came into contact with the Oe family, she had complete control over the family.\nIn July 2011, Miyoko’s desire grew, and she also wanted to get ownership of the Oe family’s land, which was owned by Kazuko Oe, who was in her 60s.\nSo she tested Oe and Kazuko’s obedience and asked her to jump voluntarily, only to have Oe and Kazuko refuse.\nThis was not just a self-preserving refusal, but a humiliation of Miyoko’s brilliant record, and from then on, Kazuko Oe became the target of a family group fight under Miyoko’s targeting.\nMiyoko’s supervision of Kazuko became even stricter.\nShe could only eat two meals a day, go to the toilet twice a day, and from mid-August, she drank less than 500cc of water a day, and even sleeping was restricted.\nWhenever Kazuko did not comply, she was beaten by Kawamura, Miyoko’s right hand man and former son-in-law.\nUnder Miyoko’s control, the family gradually developed a pyramid structure, with Miyoko, who had the highest power, at the top of the hierarchy.\nBelow Miyoko is her son-in-law Kawamura, who is subservient to her orders, further down is her wife Yumi and sister Kaede, and at the bottom is her elderly mother Kazuko Oe, all of whom have the right to beat Kazuko Oe to protect themselves.\nThe Japanese houses were not very well insulated, and the neighbors heard the screams and called the police several times, but they were never taken seriously by the police.\nThe elderly mother, Kazuko, simply could not withstand the constant abuse, and the family’s first victim was born.\nIn the summer of 2011, at 9:00 pm.\nThe family punched and kicked Kazuko in a nearby park, a beating named by Miyoko: the family’s vent. The beating had been going on for 20 minutes until neighbors around the area saw it and called the police, who arrived.\nThe most brilliant thing about Miyoko is that she knows that the way to make the family completely cut off the idea of calling the police is to get blood on everyone’s hands and become a grasshopper on a rope.\nShe wanted to use the family’s hands to kill the disobedient Kazuko.\nOn September 11, 2011, under Miyoko’s instructions, the family of four beat the sleeping Kazuko again, and the 66-year-old Kazuko Oe was beaten to death alive by her daughters.\nAfter Kazuko’s death, Miyoko decided to fake it as a suicide and had Kawamura write the family’s suicide note, leaving all the land, property and house to Miyoko.\nMiyoko is also very experienced in handling corpses, and the first thing she does is soak the dead Kazuko in ice water in the bathtub of her apartment.\nAnd immediately ordered Kawamura to buy iron barrels and fill the bodies with cement to abandon them in the abandoned warehouse.\nEveryone is the murderer who killed Kazuko with their own hands, no one can escape and no one will call the police, which completely reassures Miyoko.\nHer sister Kaiai holds guilt over her mother’s death, which also annoys Miyoko.\nKaiai took Kazuko’s place and was targeted by the whole family.\nOn October 30, 2011, Kawamura and Miyoko tied up and imprisoned Ka Ai in a car near their apartment, leaving her to fend for herself.\nKao-ai, who was lucky enough to escape, fled to Osaka alone and gradually resumed her normal life in anonymity.\nSeeing this, do you think that Kaede really escaped?\nThe answer is no, Miyoko never let go of any opportunity to exploit a loophole.\nAfter Kaede escaped, she immediately ran to the police station to report the crime, crying and saying.\n“My important family member is missing, please inform me as soon as the police have any information!\nUnaware of this, the police informed Miyoko that Kaiai had changed her driver’s license in Osaka.\nThis time, Kao-ai, who was captured and brought home, never escaped alive.\nKawamura threw Kaiai’s body into the sea and was caught by the police as a result, after which Miyoko and the family were all arrested.\nBecause of the long-term dietary restrictions, his wife, Yumi, was on the verge of starvation when she was arrested, weighing only 70 pounds, and Kawamura’s weight had also plummeted by 70 pounds.\nEven though the evidence was overwhelming, Kawamura claimed his innocence at the trial on the grounds that he had lost his mind through Miyoko’s confusion, but there were signs that he always had a clear head.\nThe police and the judge, both became curious about Miyoko, who possessed incredible criminal abilities.\nUnfortunately, after her arrest, Miyoko committed suicide in the detention center.\n(Miyoko Kakuta, 64, at the time of her arrest) The investigator asked the family what they thought of Miyoko.\nKawamura said that although Miyoko had ruined his family, she had been more kind to him.\nKaiai, on the other hand, did not want to judge Miyoko at all, but rather regretted that she had beaten her mother.\nIt seems that even after Miyoko’s arrest, the family could not free themselves from the dominated spirit and even fell into a certain worship of Miyoko.\nThe Oe family, Miyoko’s last case in her 25 years of work, is a mind-boggling but interlocking case, skilful and masterful.\nAfter looking up a lot of information, I found that Miyoko was just an ordinary woman in the early days.\nHow did Miyoko master these abilities and become a top murderer who “manipulates human nature” step by step?\n02\n“Miyoko Kakuta with a mysterious charm”\nWhat is the origin of this mysteriously attractive Miyoko Kakuta?\nLooking at her early life, we can see how a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer was formed step by step.\nIn 1948, Miyoko and her younger sister Mieko were born in Amagasaki City into an unhappy family with parents who often quarreled and a father who was a very powerful local contractor.\nAround the 1960s, many Japanese manual laborers came to Amagasaki to work, and her father let the workers live in his house, taking 40% of their hard-earned money and sometimes providing them with alcohol, and using “whips and sugar” to train them to be “obedient. The “whip and sugar” is used to train the workers to be “obedient”.\nFrom her childhood experience, Miyoko realized that people could be manipulated.\nWhen her parents decided to divorce when she was in middle school, Miyoko and her younger sister had to move from one parent to the other, living in a state of uncertainty.\nHer parents’ indifferent family atmosphere accompanied her throughout her teenage years and planted the seed of distrust in her heart.\nAt that time, she was in the rebellious stage, and rebellious girls always seem to want to prove something.\nAfter graduating from junior high school, Miyoko, who wanted to live like an adult, moved in with her ex-husband.\nOn April 10, 1972, at the age of 23, Miyoko and her ex-husband registered their marriage and devoted themselves to being a housewife.\nAt that time, she, like millions of ordinary women, lived an ordinary life and took care of her family after marriage, but she also had her own insistence that she was determined not to have children.\nSuch a woman, what do you think she should be characterized?\nMy ex-husband, who lived together for 10 years, said Miyoko was just a very timid woman who would cry and cry when she got angry.\n“One time when I got separated from the subway at Kyobashi station, she cried and waited for me on the platform because she was afraid of getting lost.\nMy ex-husband couldn’t believe that this timid woman would become the murderer of a major crime that shocked Japan.\nWhat made Miyoko’s amazing change was this next experience.\nMarriage didn’t really give Miyoko what she wanted ……\nJust 2 years later, Miyoko, divorced from her ex-husband, actually opened an erotic bar on her own and was introduced to people offering exciting special services.\nThe bar was so mixed that Miyoko became acquainted with the local yakuza group and was covered as long as she paid protection money.\nHer friends in the yakuza gave her great peace of mind, and Miyoko was the first to call someone to deal with any trouble in the store.\nMore and more customers were put to rest, and the thrill of bringing people to their knees through violence made Miyoko revel in it. The long time contact with the yakuza allowed her to secretly learn the yakuza tactics of suppressing people and using violence to break down resistance.\nAs the owner of a porn bar, Miyoko also gradually learned the skills of charming men. After understanding the psychology of men, she became more and more sophisticated in her social skills.\nMiyoko’s life became more and more regular, and she played the video game “Kinko’s Palace” during the day and went to bars with her yakuza friends at night, so no one dared to mess with her.\nIn the area of Amagasaki Hangase, the “not to be messed with” Miyoko gradually became more and more famous, and some people even asked her to come out to settle some disputes in the neighborhood.\nThis life lasted for 15 years, and when Miyoko was 40 years old, she closed the porn bar for unknown reasons.\nAfter reading a lot of information, I analyzed that Miyoko joined the yakuza because she found out that the yakuza made money quickly and did not have to pretend with customers and enjoyed a high status, so she joined the yakuza.\nIn the years after closing the porn bar, Miyoko evaporated as if she had disappeared, and no one knew exactly where she had gone before that until she did her first crime and began her plan to take over.\nIt was only after her arrest and imprisonment that Miyoko’s true appearance, at the age of 64, gradually became known to us from the lips of her cellmates.\nThe woman who lived with Miyoko for two weeks in shared custody said she had a complicated personality.\n“Sometimes she cries at night, talks to herself, and is an unpredictable person.\nWhen a prisoner was later brought in for the murder of her own son, Miyoko reminded her that\n“That woman is out of her mind, she even killed her own son, don’t talk to her, be careful.\nWith her normal outlook and unexpectedly warm heart, Miyoko is able to be a good friend to the inmates in the same room, given the huge contrast of the “tragic case of the extermination of the family”.\nPerhaps it was the years of running a porn bar that helped Miyoko master the skill of getting close to people quickly.\nWhat kind of person is Miyoko Kakuta? And what is her inner thoughts like?\nAfter field research, Kaoru Takamura, one of Japan’s top three speculative writers, believes that Miyoko has the shadow of an ordinary woman’s loneliness, an emotion that a murderer should not have, so Miyoko forces herself to strip away this emotion and becomes numb to everything.\nFrom her first days as a porn bar owner to her suicide in detention, Miyoko was always sober, she had a clear goal, knew what she wanted, and didn’t care about morality, law or even humanity, there was a negative and pessimistic side to her character from the beginning to the end.\nAfter her arrest, Miyoko repeatedly complained to the prison guards.\n“There is no point in living anymore, I want to kill myself, when can I die?\nFinally, on the eve of her trial, she hanged herself in the detention center with a rope made of futon and clothes, leaving everything for posterity to guess.\nHow did Miyoko Kakuta use her powers to become a “serial manipulative killer” that would leave the world in awe?\n03\n“The Hashimoto Family Test Site\nThe Hashimoto family was Miyoko’s first family to test the waters, and it was also the first “murder case”.\nAt that time, Miyoko’s methods were still very young, and it took her a lot of effort just to find a reason to invade the family relationship.\nThrough this case, we may be able to find a glimpse of Miyoko Kakuta’s early days.\nHow did the Hashimoto family come to be targeted by Miyoko? It starts with Miyoko’s own sister, Mieko.\nIn 1981, Mieko used some kind of trick to charm the Hashimoto family’s eldest son and moved in with the Hashimoto family, while Miyoko was running a porn bar in Amagasaki City at the same time.\nIn 2001, Mieko married the Hashimoto family’s eldest son, and Miyoko became a relative of the Hashimoto family, by which time Miyoko had closed the porn bar and joined a yakuza organization.\nThis tragedy of the Hashimoto family was planned by Miyoko together with her sister Mieko.\nBecause the Hashimoto family was small, just a family of three, it was very well controlled.\nIn 2005, Mieko and her husband climbed a mountain, and while taking pictures, kept making her husband back up and fall off a cliff, and Mieko subsequently received a huge insurance payout.\nThe sisters felt that it was not enough, and Miyoko wanted to drain the Hashimoto family of their assets, so the plan began.\nOnce the Hashimoto family’s oldest son died, the family was left with their 71-year-old mother and 54-year-old second son. The sisters violently watched over the two and abused them for six full years, during which Miyoko’s brother dated and killed the Hashimoto family’s elderly mother, and in 2011 the Hashimoto family’s only living second son was also abused and killed, and the sisters put the remains in an oil drum to destroy the body.\nBecause of the age and lack of records, the case was not filed by the police and has remained hidden until now.\nMiyoko inherited the entire Hashimoto family’s estate, and perhaps because the crime went so smoothly that even the police were unable to detect it, Miyoko felt a great sense of validation and learned from her sister Miyoko’s experience and prepared to commit the crime alone.\n04\n“A funeral that draws fire”\nWith the successful experience of the Hashimoto family, Miyoko felt that the matter of destroying the family and taking over the property was very feasible.\nShe begins to optimize her process and hone her PUA skills one family at a time. In the next two cases, Miyoko learns how to break up trust relationships from within the family, and she gradually masters the ability to destroy large families.\nThe unfortunate Kadokawa family and the Yokogi family become Miyoko’s practice tools.\nThese two families are huge, and both are related to Miyoko’s family by marriage, making them natural fertilizers in Miyoko’s eyes.\nAt first, Ms. Haru, an aunt of the Kadokawa family, married into the Kakuta family and became Miyoko’s eldest mother, but later divorced and returned to live with the Kadokawa family until her illness and death.\nAt Ms. Haru’s funeral, Miyoko comes uninvited and expresses her dissatisfaction to the Kadokawa family on the grounds that Ms. Haru’s funeral was too modest.\nMiyoko shouted: “A woman who marries a Kakuda family is a Kakuda family member,” which made everyone present afraid to make a sound.\nAt the funeral, there were not only people from the Kadokawa family, but also the Yokochi family.\nCounting up, the Yokodi family was the in-laws of the Menshe family, because Ms. Haru’s sister, Ms. Natsu, was married to the Yokodi family.\nThe dozen or so people present were then subdued by Miyoko’s boldness, and Miyoko, while pounding on the table, sharply counted the misdeeds of both families.\n“Haru is the one who married into our Kakuta family! She will be buried with my uncle, what are you going to do with the money for the funeral and the ashes?”\nThe two families had never met such a rude person before, and the funeral was indeed rather simple, so they looked at each other and didn’t know what to do.\nMiyoko observed the reaction of the two families and continued her pressure.\nIn the following days, she gathered the two families together and called the juniors, the daughters-in-law, over for a family meeting.\nAt the meeting, Miyoko seemed to be looking for a breakthrough. At this time, Miyoko was still in an unskilled stage in sowing discord.\nShe discovers that her children are unwilling to support Ms. Ha, and that there is natural infighting between the two families.\nMiyoko was so happy that she knew Ms. Ha’s son could not repay a loan shark, so she promised to help him deal with his debts and used her financial strength to gain a voice in both families.\nThose years in the yakuza taught Miyoko the truth: first let others owe her, she can pry a bigger cake.\nSo Miyoko, who had settled the loan sharks, began to extort money from the two families frequently, and according to the investigation, in just two years, Miyoko pocketed all the property.\nThis is the end of the story, right?\nBut then, Ms. Xia’s third son couldn’t afford to pay back the money Miyoko lent him to repay the loan sharks and ran away.\nMiyoko was still worried about how to find the next breakthrough, and with this incident, she morally suppressed the two families.\nShe began to try to apply the same kind of regulatory tactics from the yakuza to the family.\nThe yakuza are good at interrogation, destroying a person’s willpower with various forms of violence, and Miyoko has learned these techniques to a tee.\nWhile violently guarding and interrogating the two families, she picked two of the younger ones to adopt as her sons.\nThe neighbors reported the case several times, but the police rejected it on the grounds that “internal family conflicts are not dealt with”.\nThe two poor families were torn apart by the endless abuse.\nIn 1999, Ms. Xia was tortured to death by her three sons, and Miyoko was already very skilled in the art of murder by knife.\nTakeshi Kadokoro gathered the courage to turn himself in at the police station, but the witnesses were too afraid of Miyoko to come forward, and the family was too afraid to confess because of their involvement in Ms. Natsu’s murder, and the last report, which ended in failure, was made.\nOnce again, Miyoko easily escaped the law. Having killed two people in a row without being convicted, Miyoko became more and more satisfied with her abilities.\nHer inflated self-confidence made the crime more and more rampant.\n“Which family should I start with next? Let’s do something more exciting!”\n05\n“An exciting blood slaughter”\nAfter destroying three families in a row, Miyoko slowly found the knack to evolve into a skilled murderer.\nShe knows very well that the families she can directly or indirectly hook up with are the best dishes to be harvested.\nTaking advantage of the weaknesses of human society and following the trail, she could always find the next family.\nSo she targeted her ex-husband’s circle of friends, using the natural goodwill of relatives to get close to each other.\nMiyoko went from picking the family to penetrating the inner circle with increasing speed and a steady and precise entry point.\nThe Kaikichi family would never have imagined that an ordinary exchange of pleasantries would become an invitation to death.\nThe Kaikichi’s eldest son and Miyoko’s ex-husband were alumni from high school, and Miyoko quickly climbed into conversation with the other.\nIn 2001, the two met and kept in touch.\nIn 2002, Miyoko began to visit the Kaikichi’s home several times.\nRemember at the beginning when we introduced Miyoko’s experience of opening a porn bar?\nMiyoko used her old ability to seduce men in this hunt. She was so skilled in her business that she charmed the Kaikichi’s eldest son and invited the Kaikichi’s eldest and second sons to come and live in her apartment together.\nIt is worth mentioning that this apartment of hers was originally the property of the Hashimoto family.\nAfter 11 months of living together, Miyoshi’s eldest son was compelled by Miyoko to quit his job and Miyoko began to reveal her true nature.\nThe two brothers who came to their senses succeeded in escaping in 2007 and changed their names to begin a long life on the run.\nWith Miyoko’s character, the rest of the Kaikichi family could not be spared.\nIn 2003, the 87-year-old mother of the Kaikichi family, who stayed at home, was taken by Miyoko to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, where she was imprisoned and abused to death, and her remains were buried near the Tanimoto family home in Takamatsu City.\nThe strange thing is.\nMiyoko never did anything meaningless, so why did she have to take an 87-year-old man all the way to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, which is very far away?\nAfter combing through a large number of cases, I found that Miyoko was becoming more and more skillful in manipulating her family, not only destroying families at a faster pace, but also maturing in her methods and abilities.\nShe even started a two-pronged plan to destroy the next family in the process of “finishing” the last one.\nThat’s right, Miyoko is imprisoning the Kaikichi family while looking for her next family.\nShe is no longer satisfied with eating the grass on the edge, she wants to verify something bigger.\nThe unfortunate Tanimoto family is the first “stranger” family Miyoko tries.\nThe Tanimoto family was Miyoko’s penultimate crime before she was caught, marking the full maturity of Miyoko’s methods.\nIt was scalable, batchable, and so efficient that the process was already fixed.\nThe Tanimoto family and the Oe family mentioned at the beginning are very ordinary, ordinary people, and Miyoko can be considered strangers.\nHow to bring down a strange family? After thinking about it day and night, Miyoko cut into the family as a friend.\nThe kind and happy Tanimoto family of four could not have imagined that the family would be completely destroyed by this old woman whom they knew from one side.\nThe police information on the Tanimoto family murder is not comprehensive, after reviewing a lot of information, I will restore the most critical part of the case.\nMr. Tanimoto and his wife, Mrs. Hatsushiro, had two daughters, Jasmine, the eldest, and Rukia, the youngest.\nNo one could have imagined that years later, the younger daughter Rukia would become the murderer of her sister Jasmineko.\nNot only did Rukia recognize Miyoko as her mother and obey her, but she also married Miyoko’s adopted son and became a complete accomplice.\n(The four members of the Tanimoto family, left sister Rukia and right sister Jasako) In 2003, Miyoko frequently visited the Tanimoto family in Takamatsu City as a friend. In the morning, she was laughing and joking with the Tanimoto family, but in the afternoon, she went to the house in Takamatsu City to abuse the elderly mother of the Kaikichi family.\nWith the fat of the Tanimoto family, Miyoko was not slow to give the Kaikichi family to wrap up the disposal of their property and destroy the body.\nFrom controlling the family to completely appropriating the Tanimoto family’s property, this time, Miyoko took less than half a year.\nShe brought 10 socialites to the Tanimoto family and stayed there for half a year, violently driving the Tanimoto family to live on the second floor to prevent them from escaping and putting the yakuza on duty in shifts every day.\nLocking the defenseless women in the hut, they inflicted violence while mentally pressuring them with.\n“You should know exactly what you are, you are a disgrace to society!”\nShe made the family members write down bad things about each other, mastered the conflicts between each of them, called the younger ones out to talk alone, instilled bad things about the elders, and forced them to be loyal to herself.\nThe family then became a scene of holding each other back and targeting each other, and Miyoko established a new order without having to watch over it herself.\nEvery morning the Tanimoto family was forced to produce 200,000 yen in cash, and in just six months Miyoko took more than 20 million yen (equivalent to about 1.2 million yuan).\nShe made the family kill each other, taking the younger generation as hostages to threaten the elders to obey, and everyone was unable to resist.\nIn contrast, her sister Jasmineko was personally strong-willed and was not brainwashed by Miyoko.\nMr. Tanimoto realizes that there is only one chance to ask for help with this tight control of Miyoko! He found the right moment to pretend to quarrel with his wife, Ms. Hatsushiro, and took advantage of the chaos to let Jasako escape. The confused Jasako was ready to go to take the train to leave the city, but the train required identity registration and was arrested back by Miyoko on the grounds that her family was running amok.\nHer sister, Jasmine, is not at all obedient, so Miyoko has her sister, Rukia, who has been completely brainwashed, take her to her apartment in Amagasaki City and imprison her, where Rukia recognizes Miyoko as her mother and marries Miyoko’s son, becoming a member of the Kakuta family.\nRukia abused Jasako more and more, burning herself with a firearm and burning herself with a cigarette was a common occurrence.\nThe neighbors had called the police as many as 36 times, and like the victims of other cases, the police refused to investigate on the grounds that the case could not be filed if not reported by the victim herself.\nLike Kaiai Oe, Jasako was surprisingly lucky to escape, and she moved to Osaka to live her life anonymously and anew, unwilling to call the police because of her own involvement in the abuse of her family.\nJasako’s quiet life lasted for 2 years and 11 months.\nDecember 2006.\nAlso for the reason of changing her driver’s license, the police informed Miyoko of Jasako’s whereabouts. Jasako was once again taken back by her sister who had come a long way and was brutally abused to death, and her mother, Ms. Hatsushiro, was also abused to death by her sister in her old home.\nAfter appropriating all of the Tanimoto family’s property and stealing a daughter as a family member and killing Tanimoto’s wife and eldest daughter, Miyoko was completely satisfied to call it quits.\nDuring the same year, Miyoko set her sights on the unrelated Oe family …………\nAfter sorting through all the cases, I realized that Miyoko did not start off with such a perfect crime.\nShe had periods of trial and error, but because she firmly grasped the psychology of the murdered families, exploited the loopholes in the police and the law, got away with it again and again, and refined her criminal techniques to perfection, she was able to create seven tragic cases that spanned 25 years.\nBehind the seven cases, Miyoko also has something different from ordinary serial killers.\nShe clearly came for her fortune, but then she forced the families, who were drained of their economic value, to die one by one.\nIt seems to be some kind of pleasure for her to break the superficial harmony between human beings, and to see the family members being suspicious of each other may be one of her motives for committing the crime.\nWhat kind of mood did Miyoko have to commit her crime?\nWhat was her real motive? With Miyoko’s suicide after her arrest, there is no way to know.\n06\n\" The Final Trial and the End \"\nOn September 25, 2013, the last case opened in Kobe.\nThe 25-year-long “Idea Serial Murder Case”, in which at least seven families were completely destroyed, finally came to an end.\nAll the members of the family who were directly or indirectly involved in the killings were convicted to varying degrees.\nThe Kagawa Prefectural Police Department, which ignored 36 calls from the murdered families, publicly admitted its inadequacy, and as the case shocked Japanese society, the Hyogo Prefectural Police and the Kagawa Prefectural Police set up a new department to analyze the inquiries received by each police station.\nJapan has also introduced policies related to disputes between relatives and neighbors.\nThe media have speculated about Miyoko Kakuta’s motive for the crime, but it remains foggy.\nRegarding Miyoko as a person, there are some contradictions in her unusual modus operandi and motive that feel reasonable but perverse that deserve attention.\nCombined with criminal psychology and police speculation, most murderers with strange personalities are used to living alone.\nInstead, Miyoko formed an extended family with eight unrelated people throughout the series of cases. From the narrative of the previous cases, we can see that she has an obsession with children and likes to adopt them. And this group of her family members rely on her to make ends meet.\nOn one hand, she is constantly destroying other people’s families, and on the other hand, she sets out to build her own family.\nMiyoko seems to keep proving the dark side of human nature and the fragility of love in various cruel ways in different families. This also reinforces her belief in the pessimistic ideas she previously subscribed to.\nEvery time she provoked family relationships, she watched silently. Sometimes with silent tears on the sidelines, other times with a self-deprecating smile.\nFor 25 years, the collapse of every family seemed to start with the provocation of the couple’s relationship, and every couple’s family was her testing ground. And each couple’s relationship eventually, not surprisingly, broke down, with both sides even fist-fighting.\nAs events progress to a later stage, this break-up gradually rises again between the two generations, intensifying. Throughout the spectatorship, Miyoko seems to be watching everything from God’s perspective.\nCombined with Miyoko’s family of origin and early childhood experiences, one cannot help but venture a guess that Miyoko may have been subconsciously reverting to the traumatic experiences of her childhood, to the episodes where her family had a significant impact on her psyche.\nPerhaps she is verifying, trying to repeatedly confirm whether there is a true love that will not break, whether there is a love in the family that can never be provoked?\nOr maybe she is just making herself admit over and over again in a case that really happened, admitting that the pessimism in her own eyes is what the world was supposed to be like ……\nPerhaps the world in Miyoko’s eyes can be touched with one sentence.\nWhen you get used to pessimism, it can be as pleasant as optimism.\n– Bennett\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>If you are an ordinary 64-year-old grandmother, want to effortlessly screw up 7 families, what should you do?</p>
<p>Eat people&rsquo;s money, make the man obsessed with the old and decrepit you and the beautiful wife divorce, even do not even want to work, give you the house property, without your own hands, so that all the people who do not listen to you are killed.</p>
<p>Pretty golden handshake, right?</p>
<p>In reality, can it really be done?</p>
<p>The answer is, yes.</p>
<p>A 64 year old woman has killed 8 people, 3 disappeared, and wiped out 7 families in 25 years through psychological manipulation.</p>
<p>She was addicted to killing, a sadistic drama called humanity.</p>
<p>In 2011, Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan.</p>
<p>The police station, which was quiet as usual, suddenly received a rush of phone calls &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come quickly! This family is dying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big case of human lives, let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<p>The police immediately dispatched a team and found the body of Kazuko Oe, a 66-year-old woman who had been missing for a long time, in a barrel filled with cement in a rented warehouse, according to the location reported by a neighbor.</p>
<p>Homicide cases are not rare in Amagasaki City, but they are common in Japan.</p>
<p>The police thought it was just an ordinary murder case and were going to visit the victim&rsquo;s family, but only when they went there did they realize something was wrong.</p>
<p>The family was almost &ldquo;exterminated&rdquo;, and Kazuko Oe was brutally murdered and abused by her family.</p>
<p>The police were horrified, and as they investigated deeper, they found that the murderer of Kazuko Oe was not the murderer, but all six members of the Oe family were victims.</p>
<p>The most suspected murderer was actually a stranger who had nothing to do with it - a 64-year-old woman named Miyoko Kakuta!</p>
<p>How in the world did this old woman do it?</p>
<p>How could a good family kill each other?</p>
<p>As the police investigate, a 25-year old serial manipulation murder case emerges.</p>
<p>Seven families were completely wiped out, eight people died and three were missing.</p>
<p>Wives and daughters turned against each other, relatives abused and killed each other, and not only meekly surrendered their property and houses, but also obeyed the killer.</p>
<p>Miyoko Kakuta, who never did anything herself, got everything by manipulating the knife and killing people.</p>
<p>This is the most bizarre mass murder case in Japanese history - the Amagasaki murder dead body abandonment case.</p>
<p>The question is, how did she, with her thin figure and 64 years of age, destroy so many families? ,</p>
<p>01</p>
<p>&ldquo;A body poured with cement&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Miyoko Kakuta&rsquo;s last case before her arrest, and the one that best demonstrates her ability to charm people.</p>
<p>After looking up a lot of information, I will show you how Miyoko Kakuta destroyed her family step by step, harvested her property, and killed people with a knife.</p>
<p>After sorting out the case information, in addition to lamenting the fragility of human nature, I also had to admit that Miyoko&rsquo;s methods are so high, the criminal psychological complexity.</p>
<p>This case is very top, after reading it, I believe you will have a better understanding of human nature.</p>
<p>The last victim is the 66-year-old woman mentioned at the beginning, Kazuko Oe.</p>
<p>An investigating police officer lamented, &ldquo;If the Oe family, had not met her, perhaps they would have grown old peacefully and happily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But fate is always strange, you can&rsquo;t predict which time and strangers crossed paths, will make their own destruction.</p>
<p>The Oe family is a very ordinary working family, a family of six people live on the land under the name of Kazuko Oe, Kazuko Oe is the only old man in the family, the second daughter Yumi and son-in-law Hiroyuki Kawamura have two daughters in elementary school, the eldest daughter Kaede is not yet married, the family life is ordinary and happy.</p>
<p>In 2003, the Oe family decided to refurbish the old house for Kazuko&rsquo;s old age, so they built a small three-story building in the name of their son-in-law Kawamura.</p>
<p>(Oe&rsquo;s family chart)</p>
<p>One day in April 2009.</p>
<p>Kawamura, who was going to work on the Hankyu subway as usual, suddenly heard a cry of alarm from the carriage.</p>
<p>Kawamura rushed over and pulled the stuck stroller and the anxious Miyoko out of danger just as the doors were about to close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a life saver, please be sure to come to my house and I will thank you personally!</p>
<p>Kawamura waved his hand in embarrassment, thinking it was his duty.</p>
<p>But Miyoko was very sincere, so Kawamura went to Miyoko&rsquo;s house as a guest, unable to resist the warm invitation.</p>
<p>At this time, Kawamura did not realize that this would be the beginning of his future misfortune.</p>
<p>With the unique amiability and social skills of an older person, Miyoko and Kawamura then maintained a pleasant relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a big deal to save the baby&rsquo;s life, so I can&rsquo;t thank her enough!</p>
<p>With Miyoko&rsquo;s enthusiasm, Kawamura was invited to her home at least 20 times, and the two of them gradually talked like friends, and Kawamura&rsquo;s work-related matters were gradually revealed to Miyoko.</p>
<p>Miyoko had a plan in mind.</p>
<p>On the grounds that the subway was mismanaged and caused the passenger&rsquo;s baby to be caught, she filed a request for compensation with Kawamura&rsquo;s workplace, Hankyu Subway.</p>
<p>With her justifiable reason, and Miyoko&rsquo;s attitude of making a big deal out of it, Kawamura and her supervisor had a big headache.</p>
<p>The supervisor agreed to pay 30,000 yen in the name of the company, but Miyoko, who saw the possibility of the matter, immediately used a threatening tone and offered to pay 200,000 yen herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over, or I&rsquo;ll make a scene and let your company executives know!</p>
<p>The timid Kawamura wanted to settle the matter and gave Miyoko a promise under the disapproving gaze of her boss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t get 200,000, so I&rsquo;ll pay you 180,000 yen and give you 90,000 yen each time.</p>
<p>Like most people, Kawamura, who just wanted to settle the matter privately, was the perfect prey in Miyoko&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Miyoko knew that Kawamura would definitely be cold to her if she made such a fuss, so in order to bring her closer, she explained her reasons for doing so to the Kawamura couple at the dinner table under the guise of treating them to dinner.</p>
<p>The Kawamura couple also had two daughters, and as they were both parents, they could understand each other&rsquo;s feelings, and the three of them ate happily.</p>
<p>Miyoko, who had great social skills, used her magic charm and conversation to quickly win the Kawamura couple&rsquo;s favor, and they remained friends for the next eight months.</p>
<p>But, it was just the calm before the storm. Miyoko was like a snake, waiting for an opportunity to move and had great patience with her prey.</p>
<p>The year-long friendship made the Kawamura couple lose their wariness of Miyoko.</p>
<p>Kawamura also used to go to Miyoko after work to talk, and occasionally would spill his family and workplace grievances to Miyoko, who gently expressed her understanding and enlightened him, while silently calculating in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a poor guy, let&rsquo;s start with him&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Miyoko then found a suitable opportunity to lend Kawamura 20,000 yen, without mentioning anything about paying him back, and said she would like to invite the Kawamura couple to dinner.</p>
<p>After that, Miyoko and the Kawamura couple often get together on weekends, and Miyoko pays for all the meals, and never mentions AA, so that the Kawamura couple acquiesces that they treat themselves every time.</p>
<p>In the process of getting along, Miyoko conquered the Kawamura couple with her personal charm, and her goodwill level was already full.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time had come, Miyoko started the first round of action.</p>
<p>She calculated the meal cost for several meals and determined that the amount was so huge that the other party could not afford it, so she asked the Kawamura couple for the previous loan and AA meal cost, knowing that the other party would not refuse her request because they were embarrassed.</p>
<p>The status of the Kawamura couple and Miyoko changed. The guilty Kawamura couple could not get that much money at once, so they had to apologize to Miyoko on their knees in the park, and Miyoko took this opportunity to punch and kick the Kawamura couple, expressing her disappointment in their family.</p>
<p>She also persuaded Kawamura to quit his unprofitable job and leave the troublesome family that was asking him to spend money everywhere.</p>
<p>Even though Miyoko has gone too far, Kawamura and his wife are in the wrong, so they have to swallow their anger.</p>
<p>When Kawamura&rsquo;s idea of opening a cafe comes to her attention, Miyoko promises Kawamura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, I&rsquo;ll take care of the land! I&rsquo;ll take care of the land! Don&rsquo;t be a big man and make a decision!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Kawamura went home and told his wife that he was going to quit his iron job and open a cafe to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>His wife thought he was out of his mind and that he couldn&rsquo;t take such a risk with two daughters at home.</p>
<p>Kawamura&rsquo;s relationship with his wife gets worse and worse, and he goes to Miyoko after work to talk about his troubles.</p>
<p>Seeing that the couple&rsquo;s relationship is hardened, Miyoko seizes this opportunity to further lead Kawamura to resent his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that woman who doesn&rsquo;t support you! You two don&rsquo;t fit! &quot;</p>
<p>Miyoko was really good at PUA, so she soothed Kawamura&rsquo;s heart with her perfect lover status while fanning the flames for him to quit his job.</p>
<p>In April 2010, Kawamura resigned from his 20-year old job and bet the rest of his life on Miyoko.</p>
<p>The happy Kawamura must not have thought that his life was about to be ruined by meeting someone unlucky and not knowing people well.</p>
<p>To celebrate his departure, Miyoko gave Kawamura a batch of high-class coffee tableware, so Kawamura was full of gratitude.</p>
<p>On one side is not understand also complained about your wife, the other side is to support your dream of the perfect lover, if it were you, how would you choose?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious.</p>
<p>Kawamura was completely charmed by Miyoko, and he gave her all the 9 million yen from his company&rsquo;s severance package, the millions of yen from his loan, and even the property in his name to open a cafe.</p>
<p>With her huge fortune, Miyoko happily moves into Kawamura&rsquo;s house and starts living with Kazuko Oe&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Miyoko&rsquo;s ambition was much more than that, she wanted to squeeze everyone dry!</p>
<p>So Miyoko&rsquo;s family-destroying drama, which Miyoko had already succeeded countless times, was staged in Oe&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>After watching Miyoko&rsquo;s plan, I speculated that she herself must have excellent psychological insight, excellent social skills, know how to interrogate prisoners, and know very well the dark side of human nature, clean and crisp, extremely high psychological quality, as if hammered hundreds of times as skilled.</p>
<p>The first step of Miyoko&rsquo;s plan: to divest the opponents.</p>
<p>The first step is to turn the young couple against each other and pry the family relationship from the children.</p>
<p>Miyoko was so uncomfortable with her opinionated wife, Yumi, that for over a year, she secretly instilled in Kawamura&rsquo;s two daughters the idea that Yumi was not a good mother, and the daughters, of course, preferred the soft-spoken Miyoko to their strict mother.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of her lover&rsquo;s advantage, she also kept filling Kawamura&rsquo;s wife with bad words. Miyoko, who had taken the dominant position in the family, called everyone up for a family meeting to discuss the Kawamura couple&rsquo;s divorce.</p>
<p>The two daughters, already dissatisfied with their mother, watch the drama while expressing their desire for Miyoko to be the mother.</p>
<p>Miyoko then forces her wife, Yumi, to give up custody and divorce Kawamura.</p>
<p>Taking control of the family&rsquo;s finances is like choking a snake by the seventh inch. In order to pacify the meaningless resistance, Miyoko called her cousin Lee Masanori (an accessory, later arrested), who was in his 30s, strong and grew up admiring the Japanese yakuza, to help Miyoko control the family with violence.</p>
<p>Normally, if the robbery was purely financial, Miyoko, who had already taken the family&rsquo;s property, should have stopped.</p>
<p>Greed for money is only Miyoko&rsquo;s surface motive, what she really wants is much more than that.</p>
<p>What she wants is an experiment, a sadistic drama called humanity.</p>
<p>With the power of the yakuza, the six members of Oe&rsquo;s family no longer dared to resist.</p>
<p>Miyoko skilfully treats the family like criminals, strictly controlling everyone&rsquo;s diet, work and rest, and even going to the bathroom for up to 16 hours a day requires her consent.</p>
<p>Mentally controlled + violently assisted, almost no one could withstand this double oppression.</p>
<p>Although his wife, Yumi, divorced Kawamura, she was still trapped in the house by Miyoko. His sister, Kaiai, the only one who had contact with the outside world, was blackmailed by Miyoko with her family and had no choice but to turn her back on her fiancé and leave the company.</p>
<p>Since then, the family has been completely cut off from the outside world and has no income, living only on Miyoko&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>Miyoko uses the experience she has gained in the first half of her life to further deepen the family&rsquo;s conflict.</p>
<p>The second step of the plan: the collapse of trust.</p>
<p>Miyoko begins her experiment with human nature, dismantling the family&rsquo;s seemingly unbreakable bonds of trust.</p>
<p>Disintegrating love, disintegrating kinship, she seems to be verifying something.</p>
<p>How exactly does she turn a family that has lived for over a decade against each other in an instant?</p>
<p>The tactics are simple and brutal: if you don&rsquo;t listen, beat, beat until you listen.</p>
<p>Miyoko asked her wife, Yumi, to abuse her two children in front of the family, and when Yumi did not agree, she was frantically beaten.</p>
<p>After the wife agreed, Miyoko ridiculed the two children for their mother&rsquo;s greed and fear of death, and the two children came to resent their mother even more.</p>
<p>The erratic Miyoko suddenly slapped Yumi in a rage, announcing to the family that only she had the right to beat anyone.</p>
<p>The family, shocked by Miyoko&rsquo;s extreme character, trembled and did not dare to provoke her anger.</p>
<p>Miyoko, who knew that the only way to break up the family was from within, encouraged everyone to rat on them, but anyone who was accused would be severely beaten, and for a while everyone was cautiously staring at each other.</p>
<p>Miyoko knows human nature well, and she wants to subliminally influence the family so that they are completely enslaved and target each other.</p>
<p>In April 2011, the first person to be domesticated appeared.</p>
<p>Kawamura, who was already in a recent relationship with Miyoko and had maintained an affair, awakened the violent factor in his body after being disciplined by Miyoko.</p>
<p>Kawamura always believed that he was different in Miyoko&rsquo;s mind, and he wanted to prove to Miyoko that he was trustworthy.</p>
<p>The family under strict guard is beaten up even when they doze off. Miyoko finds out that her wife has secretly hidden a piece of chocolate and angrily beats her up. When Kawamura sees this, he joins in the beating to show his loyalty.</p>
<p>Punch after punch was thrown at his wife, shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiromi, just die trying to resist! Listen to Miyoko!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miyoko was fanning the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, use your strength!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kawamura beat his wife even harder, shattering her expectations, and the bond between them was gone.</p>
<p>Kawamura, who has become Miyoko&rsquo;s right-hand man, has changed from being the ward of the family to being the ward of the family.</p>
<p>The family&rsquo;s initial determination to secretly plan resistance and the relationship of trust with each other gradually disappears.</p>
<p>If there was any possibility of resistance in the family before, it has now become Miyoko&rsquo;s plaything.</p>
<p>The most brutal part of Miyoko&rsquo;s character was completely exposed.</p>
<p>The third step of the plan: slavery stimulation.</p>
<p>The Oe family, who had been abused for a long time, gradually developed a Stockholm mentality. Miyoko saw the beginnings and made her violent control even harsher, knowing that she was close to success.</p>
<p>Miyoko began to make everyone reflect on their mistakes by writing them down and reading them to them in violent detention, and then putting them in a small dark room where they were beaten with a special &ldquo;punishment stick&rdquo; that left them bloodied and disfigured. In addition, Miyoko degrades their self-esteem, bringing the Oe family to the brink of a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Miyoko was so satisfied that the pleasure of controlling people&rsquo;s personalities was the greatest pleasure she had gained in the first half of her life.</p>
<p>Just 2 years after Miyoko came into contact with the Oe family, she had complete control over the family.</p>
<p>In July 2011, Miyoko&rsquo;s desire grew, and she also wanted to get ownership of the Oe family&rsquo;s land, which was owned by Kazuko Oe, who was in her 60s.</p>
<p>So she tested Oe and Kazuko&rsquo;s obedience and asked her to jump voluntarily, only to have Oe and Kazuko refuse.</p>
<p>This was not just a self-preserving refusal, but a humiliation of Miyoko&rsquo;s brilliant record, and from then on, Kazuko Oe became the target of a family group fight under Miyoko&rsquo;s targeting.</p>
<p>Miyoko&rsquo;s supervision of Kazuko became even stricter.</p>
<p>She could only eat two meals a day, go to the toilet twice a day, and from mid-August, she drank less than 500cc of water a day, and even sleeping was restricted.</p>
<p>Whenever Kazuko did not comply, she was beaten by Kawamura, Miyoko&rsquo;s right hand man and former son-in-law.</p>
<p>Under Miyoko&rsquo;s control, the family gradually developed a pyramid structure, with Miyoko, who had the highest power, at the top of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Below Miyoko is her son-in-law Kawamura, who is subservient to her orders, further down is her wife Yumi and sister Kaede, and at the bottom is her elderly mother Kazuko Oe, all of whom have the right to beat Kazuko Oe to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The Japanese houses were not very well insulated, and the neighbors heard the screams and called the police several times, but they were never taken seriously by the police.</p>
<p>The elderly mother, Kazuko, simply could not withstand the constant abuse, and the family&rsquo;s first victim was born.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, at 9:00 pm.</p>
<p>The family punched and kicked Kazuko in a nearby park, a beating named by Miyoko: the family&rsquo;s vent. The beating had been going on for 20 minutes until neighbors around the area saw it and called the police, who arrived.</p>
<p>The most brilliant thing about Miyoko is that she knows that the way to make the family completely cut off the idea of calling the police is to get blood on everyone&rsquo;s hands and become a grasshopper on a rope.</p>
<p>She wanted to use the family&rsquo;s hands to kill the disobedient Kazuko.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2011, under Miyoko&rsquo;s instructions, the family of four beat the sleeping Kazuko again, and the 66-year-old Kazuko Oe was beaten to death alive by her daughters.</p>
<p>After Kazuko&rsquo;s death, Miyoko decided to fake it as a suicide and had Kawamura write the family&rsquo;s suicide note, leaving all the land, property and house to Miyoko.</p>
<p>Miyoko is also very experienced in handling corpses, and the first thing she does is soak the dead Kazuko in ice water in the bathtub of her apartment.</p>
<p>And immediately ordered Kawamura to buy iron barrels and fill the bodies with cement to abandon them in the abandoned warehouse.</p>
<p>Everyone is the murderer who killed Kazuko with their own hands, no one can escape and no one will call the police, which completely reassures Miyoko.</p>
<p>Her sister Kaiai holds guilt over her mother&rsquo;s death, which also annoys Miyoko.</p>
<p>Kaiai took Kazuko&rsquo;s place and was targeted by the whole family.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2011, Kawamura and Miyoko tied up and imprisoned Ka Ai in a car near their apartment, leaving her to fend for herself.</p>
<p>Kao-ai, who was lucky enough to escape, fled to Osaka alone and gradually resumed her normal life in anonymity.</p>
<p>Seeing this, do you think that Kaede really escaped?</p>
<p>The answer is no, Miyoko never let go of any opportunity to exploit a loophole.</p>
<p>After Kaede escaped, she immediately ran to the police station to report the crime, crying and saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My important family member is missing, please inform me as soon as the police have any information!</p>
<p>Unaware of this, the police informed Miyoko that Kaiai had changed her driver&rsquo;s license in Osaka.</p>
<p>This time, Kao-ai, who was captured and brought home, never escaped alive.</p>
<p>Kawamura threw Kaiai&rsquo;s body into the sea and was caught by the police as a result, after which Miyoko and the family were all arrested.</p>
<p>Because of the long-term dietary restrictions, his wife, Yumi, was on the verge of starvation when she was arrested, weighing only 70 pounds, and Kawamura&rsquo;s weight had also plummeted by 70 pounds.</p>
<p>Even though the evidence was overwhelming, Kawamura claimed his innocence at the trial on the grounds that he had lost his mind through Miyoko&rsquo;s confusion, but there were signs that he always had a clear head.</p>
<p>The police and the judge, both became curious about Miyoko, who possessed incredible criminal abilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after her arrest, Miyoko committed suicide in the detention center.</p>
<p>(Miyoko Kakuta, 64, at the time of her arrest)
The investigator asked the family what they thought of Miyoko.</p>
<p>Kawamura said that although Miyoko had ruined his family, she had been more kind to him.</p>
<p>Kaiai, on the other hand, did not want to judge Miyoko at all, but rather regretted that she had beaten her mother.</p>
<p>It seems that even after Miyoko&rsquo;s arrest, the family could not free themselves from the dominated spirit and even fell into a certain worship of Miyoko.</p>
<p>The Oe family, Miyoko&rsquo;s last case in her 25 years of work, is a mind-boggling but interlocking case, skilful and masterful.</p>
<p>After looking up a lot of information, I found that Miyoko was just an ordinary woman in the early days.</p>
<p>How did Miyoko master these abilities and become a top murderer who &ldquo;manipulates human nature&rdquo; step by step?</p>
<p>02</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miyoko Kakuta with a mysterious charm&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is the origin of this mysteriously attractive Miyoko Kakuta?</p>
<p>Looking at her early life, we can see how a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer was formed step by step.</p>
<p>In 1948, Miyoko and her younger sister Mieko were born in Amagasaki City into an unhappy family with parents who often quarreled and a father who was a very powerful local contractor.</p>
<p>Around the 1960s, many Japanese manual laborers came to Amagasaki to work, and her father let the workers live in his house, taking 40% of their hard-earned money and sometimes providing them with alcohol, and using &ldquo;whips and sugar&rdquo; to train them to be &ldquo;obedient. The &ldquo;whip and sugar&rdquo; is used to train the workers to be &ldquo;obedient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From her childhood experience, Miyoko realized that people could be manipulated.</p>
<p>When her parents decided to divorce when she was in middle school, Miyoko and her younger sister had to move from one parent to the other, living in a state of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Her parents&rsquo; indifferent family atmosphere accompanied her throughout her teenage years and planted the seed of distrust in her heart.</p>
<p>At that time, she was in the rebellious stage, and rebellious girls always seem to want to prove something.</p>
<p>After graduating from junior high school, Miyoko, who wanted to live like an adult, moved in with her ex-husband.</p>
<p>On April 10, 1972, at the age of 23, Miyoko and her ex-husband registered their marriage and devoted themselves to being a housewife.</p>
<p>At that time, she, like millions of ordinary women, lived an ordinary life and took care of her family after marriage, but she also had her own insistence that she was determined not to have children.</p>
<p>Such a woman, what do you think she should be characterized?</p>
<p>My ex-husband, who lived together for 10 years, said Miyoko was just a very timid woman who would cry and cry when she got angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One time when I got separated from the subway at Kyobashi station, she cried and waited for me on the platform because she was afraid of getting lost.</p>
<p>My ex-husband couldn&rsquo;t believe that this timid woman would become the murderer of a major crime that shocked Japan.</p>
<p>What made Miyoko&rsquo;s amazing change was this next experience.</p>
<p>Marriage didn&rsquo;t really give Miyoko what she wanted &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Just 2 years later, Miyoko, divorced from her ex-husband, actually opened an erotic bar on her own and was introduced to people offering exciting special services.</p>
<p>The bar was so mixed that Miyoko became acquainted with the local yakuza group and was covered as long as she paid protection money.</p>
<p>Her friends in the yakuza gave her great peace of mind, and Miyoko was the first to call someone to deal with any trouble in the store.</p>
<p>More and more customers were put to rest, and the thrill of bringing people to their knees through violence made Miyoko revel in it. The long time contact with the yakuza allowed her to secretly learn the yakuza tactics of suppressing people and using violence to break down resistance.</p>
<p>As the owner of a porn bar, Miyoko also gradually learned the skills of charming men. After understanding the psychology of men, she became more and more sophisticated in her social skills.</p>
<p>Miyoko&rsquo;s life became more and more regular, and she played the video game &ldquo;Kinko&rsquo;s Palace&rdquo; during the day and went to bars with her yakuza friends at night, so no one dared to mess with her.</p>
<p>In the area of Amagasaki Hangase, the &ldquo;not to be messed with&rdquo; Miyoko gradually became more and more famous, and some people even asked her to come out to settle some disputes in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>This life lasted for 15 years, and when Miyoko was 40 years old, she closed the porn bar for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>After reading a lot of information, I analyzed that Miyoko joined the yakuza because she found out that the yakuza made money quickly and did not have to pretend with customers and enjoyed a high status, so she joined the yakuza.</p>
<p>In the years after closing the porn bar, Miyoko evaporated as if she had disappeared, and no one knew exactly where she had gone before that until she did her first crime and began her plan to take over.</p>
<p>It was only after her arrest and imprisonment that Miyoko&rsquo;s true appearance, at the age of 64, gradually became known to us from the lips of her cellmates.</p>
<p>The woman who lived with Miyoko for two weeks in shared custody said she had a complicated personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes she cries at night, talks to herself, and is an unpredictable person.</p>
<p>When a prisoner was later brought in for the murder of her own son, Miyoko reminded her that</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman is out of her mind, she even killed her own son, don&rsquo;t talk to her, be careful.</p>
<p>With her normal outlook and unexpectedly warm heart, Miyoko is able to be a good friend to the inmates in the same room, given the huge contrast of the &ldquo;tragic case of the extermination of the family&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the years of running a porn bar that helped Miyoko master the skill of getting close to people quickly.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Miyoko Kakuta? And what is her inner thoughts like?</p>
<p>After field research, Kaoru Takamura, one of Japan&rsquo;s top three speculative writers, believes that Miyoko has the shadow of an ordinary woman&rsquo;s loneliness, an emotion that a murderer should not have, so Miyoko forces herself to strip away this emotion and becomes numb to everything.</p>
<p>From her first days as a porn bar owner to her suicide in detention, Miyoko was always sober, she had a clear goal, knew what she wanted, and didn&rsquo;t care about morality, law or even humanity, there was a negative and pessimistic side to her character from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p>After her arrest, Miyoko repeatedly complained to the prison guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no point in living anymore, I want to kill myself, when can I die?</p>
<p>Finally, on the eve of her trial, she hanged herself in the detention center with a rope made of futon and clothes, leaving everything for posterity to guess.</p>
<p>How did Miyoko Kakuta use her powers to become a &ldquo;serial manipulative killer&rdquo; that would leave the world in awe?</p>
<p>03</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hashimoto Family Test Site</p>
<p>The Hashimoto family was Miyoko&rsquo;s first family to test the waters, and it was also the first &ldquo;murder case&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At that time, Miyoko&rsquo;s methods were still very young, and it took her a lot of effort just to find a reason to invade the family relationship.</p>
<p>Through this case, we may be able to find a glimpse of Miyoko Kakuta&rsquo;s early days.</p>
<p>How did the Hashimoto family come to be targeted by Miyoko? It starts with Miyoko&rsquo;s own sister, Mieko.</p>
<p>In 1981, Mieko used some kind of trick to charm the Hashimoto family&rsquo;s eldest son and moved in with the Hashimoto family, while Miyoko was running a porn bar in Amagasaki City at the same time.</p>
<p>In 2001, Mieko married the Hashimoto family&rsquo;s eldest son, and Miyoko became a relative of the Hashimoto family, by which time Miyoko had closed the porn bar and joined a yakuza organization.</p>
<p>This tragedy of the Hashimoto family was planned by Miyoko together with her sister Mieko.</p>
<p>Because the Hashimoto family was small, just a family of three, it was very well controlled.</p>
<p>In 2005, Mieko and her husband climbed a mountain, and while taking pictures, kept making her husband back up and fall off a cliff, and Mieko subsequently received a huge insurance payout.</p>
<p>The sisters felt that it was not enough, and Miyoko wanted to drain the Hashimoto family of their assets, so the plan began.</p>
<p>Once the Hashimoto family&rsquo;s oldest son died, the family was left with their 71-year-old mother and 54-year-old second son. The sisters violently watched over the two and abused them for six full years, during which Miyoko&rsquo;s brother dated and killed the Hashimoto family&rsquo;s elderly mother, and in 2011 the Hashimoto family&rsquo;s only living second son was also abused and killed, and the sisters put the remains in an oil drum to destroy the body.</p>
<p>Because of the age and lack of records, the case was not filed by the police and has remained hidden until now.</p>
<p>Miyoko inherited the entire Hashimoto family&rsquo;s estate, and perhaps because the crime went so smoothly that even the police were unable to detect it, Miyoko felt a great sense of validation and learned from her sister Miyoko&rsquo;s experience and prepared to commit the crime alone.</p>
<p>04</p>
<p>&ldquo;A funeral that draws fire&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the successful experience of the Hashimoto family, Miyoko felt that the matter of destroying the family and taking over the property was very feasible.</p>
<p>She begins to optimize her process and hone her PUA skills one family at a time. In the next two cases, Miyoko learns how to break up trust relationships from within the family, and she gradually masters the ability to destroy large families.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Kadokawa family and the Yokogi family become Miyoko&rsquo;s practice tools.</p>
<p>These two families are huge, and both are related to Miyoko&rsquo;s family by marriage, making them natural fertilizers in Miyoko&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>At first, Ms. Haru, an aunt of the Kadokawa family, married into the Kakuta family and became Miyoko&rsquo;s eldest mother, but later divorced and returned to live with the Kadokawa family until her illness and death.</p>
<p>At Ms. Haru&rsquo;s funeral, Miyoko comes uninvited and expresses her dissatisfaction to the Kadokawa family on the grounds that Ms. Haru&rsquo;s funeral was too modest.</p>
<p>Miyoko shouted: &ldquo;A woman who marries a Kakuda family is a Kakuda family member,&rdquo; which made everyone present afraid to make a sound.</p>
<p>At the funeral, there were not only people from the Kadokawa family, but also the Yokochi family.</p>
<p>Counting up, the Yokodi family was the in-laws of the Menshe family, because Ms. Haru&rsquo;s sister, Ms. Natsu, was married to the Yokodi family.</p>
<p>The dozen or so people present were then subdued by Miyoko&rsquo;s boldness, and Miyoko, while pounding on the table, sharply counted the misdeeds of both families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haru is the one who married into our Kakuta family! She will be buried with my uncle, what are you going to do with the money for the funeral and the ashes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two families had never met such a rude person before, and the funeral was indeed rather simple, so they looked at each other and didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Miyoko observed the reaction of the two families and continued her pressure.</p>
<p>In the following days, she gathered the two families together and called the juniors, the daughters-in-law, over for a family meeting.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Miyoko seemed to be looking for a breakthrough. At this time, Miyoko was still in an unskilled stage in sowing discord.</p>
<p>She discovers that her children are unwilling to support Ms. Ha, and that there is natural infighting between the two families.</p>
<p>Miyoko was so happy that she knew Ms. Ha&rsquo;s son could not repay a loan shark, so she promised to help him deal with his debts and used her financial strength to gain a voice in both families.</p>
<p>Those years in the yakuza taught Miyoko the truth: first let others owe her, she can pry a bigger cake.</p>
<p>So Miyoko, who had settled the loan sharks, began to extort money from the two families frequently, and according to the investigation, in just two years, Miyoko pocketed all the property.</p>
<p>This is the end of the story, right?</p>
<p>But then, Ms. Xia&rsquo;s third son couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay back the money Miyoko lent him to repay the loan sharks and ran away.</p>
<p>Miyoko was still worried about how to find the next breakthrough, and with this incident, she morally suppressed the two families.</p>
<p>She began to try to apply the same kind of regulatory tactics from the yakuza to the family.</p>
<p>The yakuza are good at interrogation, destroying a person&rsquo;s willpower with various forms of violence, and Miyoko has learned these techniques to a tee.</p>
<p>While violently guarding and interrogating the two families, she picked two of the younger ones to adopt as her sons.</p>
<p>The neighbors reported the case several times, but the police rejected it on the grounds that &ldquo;internal family conflicts are not dealt with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The two poor families were torn apart by the endless abuse.</p>
<p>In 1999, Ms. Xia was tortured to death by her three sons, and Miyoko was already very skilled in the art of murder by knife.</p>
<p>Takeshi Kadokoro gathered the courage to turn himself in at the police station, but the witnesses were too afraid of Miyoko to come forward, and the family was too afraid to confess because of their involvement in Ms. Natsu&rsquo;s murder, and the last report, which ended in failure, was made.</p>
<p>Once again, Miyoko easily escaped the law. Having killed two people in a row without being convicted, Miyoko became more and more satisfied with her abilities.</p>
<p>Her inflated self-confidence made the crime more and more rampant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which family should I start with next? Let&rsquo;s do something more exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>05</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exciting blood slaughter&rdquo;</p>
<p>After destroying three families in a row, Miyoko slowly found the knack to evolve into a skilled murderer.</p>
<p>She knows very well that the families she can directly or indirectly hook up with are the best dishes to be harvested.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the weaknesses of human society and following the trail, she could always find the next family.</p>
<p>So she targeted her ex-husband&rsquo;s circle of friends, using the natural goodwill of relatives to get close to each other.</p>
<p>Miyoko went from picking the family to penetrating the inner circle with increasing speed and a steady and precise entry point.</p>
<p>The Kaikichi family would never have imagined that an ordinary exchange of pleasantries would become an invitation to death.</p>
<p>The Kaikichi&rsquo;s eldest son and Miyoko&rsquo;s ex-husband were alumni from high school, and Miyoko quickly climbed into conversation with the other.</p>
<p>In 2001, the two met and kept in touch.</p>
<p>In 2002, Miyoko began to visit the Kaikichi&rsquo;s home several times.</p>
<p>Remember at the beginning when we introduced Miyoko&rsquo;s experience of opening a porn bar?</p>
<p>Miyoko used her old ability to seduce men in this hunt. She was so skilled in her business that she charmed the Kaikichi&rsquo;s eldest son and invited the Kaikichi&rsquo;s eldest and second sons to come and live in her apartment together.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that this apartment of hers was originally the property of the Hashimoto family.</p>
<p>After 11 months of living together, Miyoshi&rsquo;s eldest son was compelled by Miyoko to quit his job and Miyoko began to reveal her true nature.</p>
<p>The two brothers who came to their senses succeeded in escaping in 2007 and changed their names to begin a long life on the run.</p>
<p>With Miyoko&rsquo;s character, the rest of the Kaikichi family could not be spared.</p>
<p>In 2003, the 87-year-old mother of the Kaikichi family, who stayed at home, was taken by Miyoko to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, where she was imprisoned and abused to death, and her remains were buried near the Tanimoto family home in Takamatsu City.</p>
<p>The strange thing is.</p>
<p>Miyoko never did anything meaningless, so why did she have to take an 87-year-old man all the way to Takamatsu City, Kagawa, which is very far away?</p>
<p>After combing through a large number of cases, I found that Miyoko was becoming more and more skillful in manipulating her family, not only destroying families at a faster pace, but also maturing in her methods and abilities.</p>
<p>She even started a two-pronged plan to destroy the next family in the process of &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; the last one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, Miyoko is imprisoning the Kaikichi family while looking for her next family.</p>
<p>She is no longer satisfied with eating the grass on the edge, she wants to verify something bigger.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Tanimoto family is the first &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; family Miyoko tries.</p>
<p>The Tanimoto family was Miyoko&rsquo;s penultimate crime before she was caught, marking the full maturity of Miyoko&rsquo;s methods.</p>
<p>It was scalable, batchable, and so efficient that the process was already fixed.</p>
<p>The Tanimoto family and the Oe family mentioned at the beginning are very ordinary, ordinary people, and Miyoko can be considered strangers.</p>
<p>How to bring down a strange family? After thinking about it day and night, Miyoko cut into the family as a friend.</p>
<p>The kind and happy Tanimoto family of four could not have imagined that the family would be completely destroyed by this old woman whom they knew from one side.</p>
<p>The police information on the Tanimoto family murder is not comprehensive, after reviewing a lot of information, I will restore the most critical part of the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Tanimoto and his wife, Mrs. Hatsushiro, had two daughters, Jasmine, the eldest, and Rukia, the youngest.</p>
<p>No one could have imagined that years later, the younger daughter Rukia would become the murderer of her sister Jasmineko.</p>
<p>Not only did Rukia recognize Miyoko as her mother and obey her, but she also married Miyoko&rsquo;s adopted son and became a complete accomplice.</p>
<p>(The four members of the Tanimoto family, left sister Rukia and right sister Jasako)
In 2003, Miyoko frequently visited the Tanimoto family in Takamatsu City as a friend. In the morning, she was laughing and joking with the Tanimoto family, but in the afternoon, she went to the house in Takamatsu City to abuse the elderly mother of the Kaikichi family.</p>
<p>With the fat of the Tanimoto family, Miyoko was not slow to give the Kaikichi family to wrap up the disposal of their property and destroy the body.</p>
<p>From controlling the family to completely appropriating the Tanimoto family&rsquo;s property, this time, Miyoko took less than half a year.</p>
<p>She brought 10 socialites to the Tanimoto family and stayed there for half a year, violently driving the Tanimoto family to live on the second floor to prevent them from escaping and putting the yakuza on duty in shifts every day.</p>
<p>Locking the defenseless women in the hut, they inflicted violence while mentally pressuring them with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know exactly what you are, you are a disgrace to society!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made the family members write down bad things about each other, mastered the conflicts between each of them, called the younger ones out to talk alone, instilled bad things about the elders, and forced them to be loyal to herself.</p>
<p>The family then became a scene of holding each other back and targeting each other, and Miyoko established a new order without having to watch over it herself.</p>
<p>Every morning the Tanimoto family was forced to produce 200,000 yen in cash, and in just six months Miyoko took more than 20 million yen (equivalent to about 1.2 million yuan).</p>
<p>She made the family kill each other, taking the younger generation as hostages to threaten the elders to obey, and everyone was unable to resist.</p>
<p>In contrast, her sister Jasmineko was personally strong-willed and was not brainwashed by Miyoko.</p>
<p>Mr. Tanimoto realizes that there is only one chance to ask for help with this tight control of Miyoko! He found the right moment to pretend to quarrel with his wife, Ms. Hatsushiro, and took advantage of the chaos to let Jasako escape. The confused Jasako was ready to go to take the train to leave the city, but the train required identity registration and was arrested back by Miyoko on the grounds that her family was running amok.</p>
<p>Her sister, Jasmine, is not at all obedient, so Miyoko has her sister, Rukia, who has been completely brainwashed, take her to her apartment in Amagasaki City and imprison her, where Rukia recognizes Miyoko as her mother and marries Miyoko&rsquo;s son, becoming a member of the Kakuta family.</p>
<p>Rukia abused Jasako more and more, burning herself with a firearm and burning herself with a cigarette was a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The neighbors had called the police as many as 36 times, and like the victims of other cases, the police refused to investigate on the grounds that the case could not be filed if not reported by the victim herself.</p>
<p>Like Kaiai Oe, Jasako was surprisingly lucky to escape, and she moved to Osaka to live her life anonymously and anew, unwilling to call the police because of her own involvement in the abuse of her family.</p>
<p>Jasako&rsquo;s quiet life lasted for 2 years and 11 months.</p>
<p>December 2006.</p>
<p>Also for the reason of changing her driver&rsquo;s license, the police informed Miyoko of Jasako&rsquo;s whereabouts. Jasako was once again taken back by her sister who had come a long way and was brutally abused to death, and her mother, Ms. Hatsushiro, was also abused to death by her sister in her old home.</p>
<p>After appropriating all of the Tanimoto family&rsquo;s property and stealing a daughter as a family member and killing Tanimoto&rsquo;s wife and eldest daughter, Miyoko was completely satisfied to call it quits.</p>
<p>During the same year, Miyoko set her sights on the unrelated Oe family &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>After sorting through all the cases, I realized that Miyoko did not start off with such a perfect crime.</p>
<p>She had periods of trial and error, but because she firmly grasped the psychology of the murdered families, exploited the loopholes in the police and the law, got away with it again and again, and refined her criminal techniques to perfection, she was able to create seven tragic cases that spanned 25 years.</p>
<p>Behind the seven cases, Miyoko also has something different from ordinary serial killers.</p>
<p>She clearly came for her fortune, but then she forced the families, who were drained of their economic value, to die one by one.</p>
<p>It seems to be some kind of pleasure for her to break the superficial harmony between human beings, and to see the family members being suspicious of each other may be one of her motives for committing the crime.</p>
<p>What kind of mood did Miyoko have to commit her crime?</p>
<p>What was her real motive? With Miyoko&rsquo;s suicide after her arrest, there is no way to know.</p>
<p>06</p>
<p>&quot; The Final Trial and the End &quot;</p>
<p>On September 25, 2013, the last case opened in Kobe.</p>
<p>The 25-year-long &ldquo;Idea Serial Murder Case&rdquo;, in which at least seven families were completely destroyed, finally came to an end.</p>
<p>All the members of the family who were directly or indirectly involved in the killings were convicted to varying degrees.</p>
<p>The Kagawa Prefectural Police Department, which ignored 36 calls from the murdered families, publicly admitted its inadequacy, and as the case shocked Japanese society, the Hyogo Prefectural Police and the Kagawa Prefectural Police set up a new department to analyze the inquiries received by each police station.</p>
<p>Japan has also introduced policies related to disputes between relatives and neighbors.</p>
<p>The media have speculated about Miyoko Kakuta&rsquo;s motive for the crime, but it remains foggy.</p>
<p>Regarding Miyoko as a person, there are some contradictions in her unusual modus operandi and motive that feel reasonable but perverse that deserve attention.</p>
<p>Combined with criminal psychology and police speculation, most murderers with strange personalities are used to living alone.</p>
<p>Instead, Miyoko formed an extended family with eight unrelated people throughout the series of cases. From the narrative of the previous cases, we can see that she has an obsession with children and likes to adopt them. And this group of her family members rely on her to make ends meet.</p>
<p>On one hand, she is constantly destroying other people&rsquo;s families, and on the other hand, she sets out to build her own family.</p>
<p>Miyoko seems to keep proving the dark side of human nature and the fragility of love in various cruel ways in different families. This also reinforces her belief in the pessimistic ideas she previously subscribed to.</p>
<p>Every time she provoked family relationships, she watched silently. Sometimes with silent tears on the sidelines, other times with a self-deprecating smile.</p>
<p>For 25 years, the collapse of every family seemed to start with the provocation of the couple&rsquo;s relationship, and every couple&rsquo;s family was her testing ground. And each couple&rsquo;s relationship eventually, not surprisingly, broke down, with both sides even fist-fighting.</p>
<p>As events progress to a later stage, this break-up gradually rises again between the two generations, intensifying. Throughout the spectatorship, Miyoko seems to be watching everything from God&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Combined with Miyoko&rsquo;s family of origin and early childhood experiences, one cannot help but venture a guess that Miyoko may have been subconsciously reverting to the traumatic experiences of her childhood, to the episodes where her family had a significant impact on her psyche.</p>
<p>Perhaps she is verifying, trying to repeatedly confirm whether there is a true love that will not break, whether there is a love in the family that can never be provoked?</p>
<p>Or maybe she is just making herself admit over and over again in a case that really happened, admitting that the pessimism in her own eyes is what the world was supposed to be like &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Perhaps the world in Miyoko&rsquo;s eyes can be touched with one sentence.</p>
<p>When you get used to pessimism, it can be as pleasant as optimism.</p>
