  "articleBody": "Faced with all the discontents in his life, Gao Shi, at the age of 52, chose to resign and go to Chang’an to become a “Beijing drifter” again.\nIt took courage to make such a decision. In ancient China, it was not uncommon for people like Tao Yuanming to resign from their posts and return to their fields because they were unhappy with their jobs, but it was rare for people like Gao Shi to resign because he was dissatisfied with his job and rejoin the capital to find a job when he was over half a century old. Gao Shi’s boldness is evident.\nIn Chang’an, Gao Shi met many old friends and made many new ones. Among Gao Shi’s old friends, the most famous one is Du Fu. In 744 A.D., Li Bai and Du Fu came to Songzhou, Gao Shi’s hometown, and Gao Shi accompanied them on their travels, leaving a good story in the history of literature. When Gao Shi came to Chang’an again, he met with Du Fu quite frequently. At the same time, Gao Shi also made many new friends, such as Zhang Xu, who was known as the “Saint of Cursive”, and Gao Shi wrote a poem to praise him, “The world is full of acquaintances, but this man is different. He was a sage in calligraphy, and he was a great loudspeaker when he was drunk. The old man with white hair has no time to spare, but the green clouds are now. A pot of wine at his bedside, how many times he can sleep” (“After getting drunk, he gave a gift to Zhang Juxu”). In addition, Gao Shi also attended many banquets held by court officials with the introduction of his friends, which enabled him to expand his network.\nIn Chang’an, although Gao Shi met his friends, he did not find a suitable job. So Gao Shi left Chang’an again and traveled west. When he arrived at the right side of the river, Gao Shi met Goshu Han, who was then the governor of the west side of the river. After some conversation, Gao Shi Han appreciated this man with frosty temples and asked him to be the secretary of his army. “The full name of this official position is “Jidu Jidu”, which is an official in charge of important documents, pilgrimages, rituals, prayers, and orders under the command of the Jidu. Although the rank of this official position was not high, it was one of the most intimate officials of the festival, which was obviously important for Gao Shi, who was already over 50 years old. Gao Shi, who had been wandering for a long time, finally found a job again.\nHere, it is necessary to introduce Goshu Han again - he would be an indispensable role in Gao Shi’s future life. Goshu Han, originally from the Goshu tribe, the head of the Western Turkic Turks, was the deputy governor of the Anxi Prefecture and ambassador of the Chishui Army (now Wuwei in Gansu), while his mother, Yuchi, was the princess of the King of Ü-Tep, a wealthy family. However, since childhood, Goshu Han was fond of drinking and gambling and did not do anything significant. It was not until he was 40 years old that Goshu Han decided to join the army to kill the enemy and came to join the army under the tent of Wang Zhan, the governor of Hexi. He came to the army in 742 A.D., but five years later in 747 A.D. he was promoted by Emperor Xuanzong to the position of Longye Festival Minister. Such a speedy promotion was inevitable.\nGoshu Han was known for his bravery in battle, and the song “Goshu Song” (“The seven stars of the Big Dipper are high, Goshu carries his sword at night. To this day, he does not dare to cross Lintao.”) is the praise of Goshu Han’s war performance. However, after Goshu Han became the Longye Festival Minister, his reputation among the people and scholars plummeted, and it all started from the battle of Shibao Castle, which he commanded.\nShibao Castle was a military fortress built by the Tubo army in today’s Qinghai province. During the reign of Tianbao, Emperor Xuanzong, who valued the achievements of the border, ordered Goshuhan’s superior, Wang Zhongsi, who was then the envoy of the Hexi and Longye Festival, to attack Shibao Castle. As a famous general of his generation, Wang Zhongsi refused to carry out the order because he thought that the fortress was extremely strong and it would cost him a lot of death and injury if he attacked it by force. This incident offended Emperor Xuanzong, who then asked Goshu Han to replace Wang Zhongsi as the Longye Festival Minister. After that, Emperor Xuanzong mobilized tens of thousands of soldiers from Shuofang and Hedong under the command of Goshu Han and ordered him to attack Shibao Castle. At this time, Goshu Han dared not disobey Emperor Xuanzong’s will again and forced the soldiers to attack the city. In the end, Wang Zhongshi’s prediction was fulfilled, and the Tang army took the city after tens of thousands of casualties, capturing only four hundred Tubo soldiers. Xuanzong was so pleased with the victory that he not only promoted Goshu Han, but also gave his son a fifth-ranking official. For a while, Goshu Han was in a great position.\nAlthough Emperor Xuanzong valued Goshu Han, he could not stop people from talking about him. Many scholars at that time and many later scholars never had a contemptuous attitude toward Goshu Han’s war service. For example, Li Bai wrote, “You can’t learn from Goshu, you can’t walk across the Qinghai Sea at night with a sword, and take the purple robe from the Western slaughter of the Stone Fort” (“Answer to Wang XII’s cold night drinking alone”), and Chao said, “I don’t have the name of Mao Gong Turk, but I am the Great Wall for my country. I am not a general of the Stone Fort, but I took the purple robe with a sword” (“Repeatedly using the previous rhyme to present a poem to Lu Zhi Tang Gong Cheng Ji Mingliu”); Su Shi wrote “The old general of Shuofang is still in the wind, but he did not take the stone fortress city of Xifan” (“Read the “Legacy of Kaiyuan Tianbao”); Xue Dasun wrote “The monarch has paid for the Juyan plug, but the old general would rather covet the stone fortress city” (“Winging History - its three”) …… and in Among these poems, the most famous one is Du Fu’s “The line of the military chariot”[1] with the line “You can’t see the head of the Qinghai Sea, the white bones of the ancient times are not collected. The new ghosts are bothered by the old ghosts crying, and the sky is cloudy and wet with the sound of chirping.” One can’t help but cover up the volume and sigh.\nOf course, these folk poems did not have any substantial impact on Goshuhan. With his victory in the battle of Shibao Castle, Goshu Han was highly favored by Emperor Xuanzong. It was at this time that Gao Shi came into the sight of Goshu Han. It was impossible for Gao Shi not to know what kind of position Goshu Han had in the court at that time. For Gao Shi, who wanted to build a successful career, there was no reason for him to refuse the invitation from Goshu Han. In this way, Gao Shi entered the army of Goshu Han and became the secretary under his command.\nI think Gao Shi was not at peace with himself when he came to Goshu Han’s army. In a hundred years ago, his grandfather Gao Jingyi had been the long right road marching general, became a generation of famous generals, a hundred years later when he came to the long right, more than half a hundred years old but only an ordinary staff, they can still afford to ancestral achievements? Gao Shi may have repeatedly asked himself.\nGao Shi’s choice, and not all of his friends to understand. At least, Du Fu, who wrote “The Line of the Bing Chariot”, felt that Gao Shi should not strive for success under someone like Goshu Han. Once, when Gao Shi followed Goshu Han to victory in battle, Du Fu wanted Gao Shi to ask Goshu Han why he had to fight in places where birds don’t shit (“Please ask the general: How can we use the poor wilderness for. (Fifteen Rhymes for Sending Gao 35 Secretaries). Du Fu even compares Gao Shi to a “hungry eagle”, “A hungry eagle, not yet full of meat, flies on its wings with others” - this is almost like accusing Gao Shi of being Goshuhan’s hawk and dog. However, Gao Shi’s reply to Du Fu was “A reply to a clerk of the clouds, who is ashamed to be known as a national scholar”. No matter what the image of Goshu Han was among the people, at least to Gao Shi, Goshu Han gave him the courtesy of a “national scholar”, and such a kindness was something Gao Shi wanted to repay. In fact, Du Fu also saw how much Goshu Han valued Gao Shi, so he said that Gao Shi would be able to lead the army on his own in about ten years (“After ten years out of the shogunate, he can hold the army command.”). (Fifteen Rhymes for Gao’s Thirty-Five Clerks). In any case, for Gao Shi, who was more than half a century old, this was probably the last chance in his life, and he had to seize it no matter what.\nOf course, what neither Gao Shi nor Du Fu expected was that it would not take ten years to take charge of the “military command” - after only three years, Gao Shi became a knight-errant with a heavy military force.\nReference ^ Regarding the background of Du Fu’s “The Chariot Line”, it is said to be a satire on the use of troops in Qinghai by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, while the other one is a satire on the use of troops in Yunnan by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Faced with all the discontents in his life, Gao Shi, at the age of 52, chose to resign and go to Chang&rsquo;an to become a &ldquo;Beijing drifter&rdquo; again.</p>
<p>It took courage to make such a decision. In ancient China, it was not uncommon for people like Tao Yuanming to resign from their posts and return to their fields because they were unhappy with their jobs, but it was rare for people like Gao Shi to resign because he was dissatisfied with his job and rejoin the capital to find a job when he was over half a century old. Gao Shi&rsquo;s boldness is evident.</p>
<p>In Chang&rsquo;an, Gao Shi met many old friends and made many new ones. Among Gao Shi&rsquo;s old friends, the most famous one is Du Fu. In 744 A.D., Li Bai and Du Fu came to Songzhou, Gao Shi&rsquo;s hometown, and Gao Shi accompanied them on their travels, leaving a good story in the history of literature. When Gao Shi came to Chang&rsquo;an again, he met with Du Fu quite frequently. At the same time, Gao Shi also made many new friends, such as Zhang Xu, who was known as the &ldquo;Saint of Cursive&rdquo;, and Gao Shi wrote a poem to praise him, &ldquo;The world is full of acquaintances, but this man is different. He was a sage in calligraphy, and he was a great loudspeaker when he was drunk. The old man with white hair has no time to spare, but the green clouds are now. A pot of wine at his bedside, how many times he can sleep&rdquo; (&ldquo;After getting drunk, he gave a gift to Zhang Juxu&rdquo;). In addition, Gao Shi also attended many banquets held by court officials with the introduction of his friends, which enabled him to expand his network.</p>
<p>In Chang&rsquo;an, although Gao Shi met his friends, he did not find a suitable job. So Gao Shi left Chang&rsquo;an again and traveled west. When he arrived at the right side of the river, Gao Shi met Goshu Han, who was then the governor of the west side of the river. After some conversation, Gao Shi Han appreciated this man with frosty temples and asked him to be the secretary of his army. &ldquo;The full name of this official position is &ldquo;Jidu Jidu&rdquo;, which is an official in charge of important documents, pilgrimages, rituals, prayers, and orders under the command of the Jidu. Although the rank of this official position was not high, it was one of the most intimate officials of the festival, which was obviously important for Gao Shi, who was already over 50 years old. Gao Shi, who had been wandering for a long time, finally found a job again.</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to introduce Goshu Han again - he would be an indispensable role in Gao Shi&rsquo;s future life. Goshu Han, originally from the Goshu tribe, the head of the Western Turkic Turks, was the deputy governor of the Anxi Prefecture and ambassador of the Chishui Army (now Wuwei in Gansu), while his mother, Yuchi, was the princess of the King of Ü-Tep, a wealthy family. However, since childhood, Goshu Han was fond of drinking and gambling and did not do anything significant. It was not until he was 40 years old that Goshu Han decided to join the army to kill the enemy and came to join the army under the tent of Wang Zhan, the governor of Hexi. He came to the army in 742 A.D., but five years later in 747 A.D. he was promoted by Emperor Xuanzong to the position of Longye Festival Minister. Such a speedy promotion was inevitable.</p>
<p>Goshu Han was known for his bravery in battle, and the song &ldquo;Goshu Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;The seven stars of the Big Dipper are high, Goshu carries his sword at night. To this day, he does not dare to cross Lintao.&rdquo;) is the praise of Goshu Han&rsquo;s war performance. However, after Goshu Han became the Longye Festival Minister, his reputation among the people and scholars plummeted, and it all started from the battle of Shibao Castle, which he commanded.</p>
<p>Shibao Castle was a military fortress built by the Tubo army in today&rsquo;s Qinghai province. During the reign of Tianbao, Emperor Xuanzong, who valued the achievements of the border, ordered Goshuhan&rsquo;s superior, Wang Zhongsi, who was then the envoy of the Hexi and Longye Festival, to attack Shibao Castle. As a famous general of his generation, Wang Zhongsi refused to carry out the order because he thought that the fortress was extremely strong and it would cost him a lot of death and injury if he attacked it by force. This incident offended Emperor Xuanzong, who then asked Goshu Han to replace Wang Zhongsi as the Longye Festival Minister. After that, Emperor Xuanzong mobilized tens of thousands of soldiers from Shuofang and Hedong under the command of Goshu Han and ordered him to attack Shibao Castle. At this time, Goshu Han dared not disobey Emperor Xuanzong&rsquo;s will again and forced the soldiers to attack the city. In the end, Wang Zhongshi&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled, and the Tang army took the city after tens of thousands of casualties, capturing only four hundred Tubo soldiers. Xuanzong was so pleased with the victory that he not only promoted Goshu Han, but also gave his son a fifth-ranking official. For a while, Goshu Han was in a great position.</p>
<p>Although Emperor Xuanzong valued Goshu Han, he could not stop people from talking about him. Many scholars at that time and many later scholars never had a contemptuous attitude toward Goshu Han&rsquo;s war service. For example, Li Bai wrote, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t learn from Goshu, you can&rsquo;t walk across the Qinghai Sea at night with a sword, and take the purple robe from the Western slaughter of the Stone Fort&rdquo; (&ldquo;Answer to Wang XII&rsquo;s cold night drinking alone&rdquo;), and Chao said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the name of Mao Gong Turk, but I am the Great Wall for my country. I am not a general of the Stone Fort, but I took the purple robe with a sword&rdquo; (&ldquo;Repeatedly using the previous rhyme to present a poem to Lu Zhi Tang Gong Cheng Ji Mingliu&rdquo;); Su Shi wrote &ldquo;The old general of Shuofang is still in the wind, but he did not take the stone fortress city of Xifan&rdquo; (&ldquo;Read the &ldquo;Legacy of Kaiyuan Tianbao&rdquo;); Xue Dasun wrote &ldquo;The monarch has paid for the Juyan plug, but the old general would rather covet the stone fortress city&rdquo; (&ldquo;Winging History - its three&rdquo;) &hellip;&hellip; and in Among these poems, the most famous one is Du Fu&rsquo;s &ldquo;The line of the military chariot&rdquo;[1] with the line &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see the head of the Qinghai Sea, the white bones of the ancient times are not collected. The new ghosts are bothered by the old ghosts crying, and the sky is cloudy and wet with the sound of chirping.&rdquo; One can&rsquo;t help but cover up the volume and sigh.</p>
<p>Of course, these folk poems did not have any substantial impact on Goshuhan. With his victory in the battle of Shibao Castle, Goshu Han was highly favored by Emperor Xuanzong. It was at this time that Gao Shi came into the sight of Goshu Han. It was impossible for Gao Shi not to know what kind of position Goshu Han had in the court at that time. For Gao Shi, who wanted to build a successful career, there was no reason for him to refuse the invitation from Goshu Han. In this way, Gao Shi entered the army of Goshu Han and became the secretary under his command.</p>
<p>I think Gao Shi was not at peace with himself when he came to Goshu Han&rsquo;s army. In a hundred years ago, his grandfather Gao Jingyi had been the long right road marching general, became a generation of famous generals, a hundred years later when he came to the long right, more than half a hundred years old but only an ordinary staff, they can still afford to ancestral achievements? Gao Shi may have repeatedly asked himself.</p>
<p>Gao Shi&rsquo;s choice, and not all of his friends to understand. At least, Du Fu, who wrote &ldquo;The Line of the Bing Chariot&rdquo;, felt that Gao Shi should not strive for success under someone like Goshu Han. Once, when Gao Shi followed Goshu Han to victory in battle, Du Fu wanted Gao Shi to ask Goshu Han why he had to fight in places where birds don&rsquo;t shit (&ldquo;Please ask the general: How can we use the poor wilderness for. (Fifteen Rhymes for Sending Gao 35 Secretaries). Du Fu even compares Gao Shi to a &ldquo;hungry eagle&rdquo;, &ldquo;A hungry eagle, not yet full of meat, flies on its wings with others&rdquo; - this is almost like accusing Gao Shi of being Goshuhan&rsquo;s hawk and dog. However, Gao Shi&rsquo;s reply to Du Fu was &ldquo;A reply to a clerk of the clouds, who is ashamed to be known as a national scholar&rdquo;. No matter what the image of Goshu Han was among the people, at least to Gao Shi, Goshu Han gave him the courtesy of a &ldquo;national scholar&rdquo;, and such a kindness was something Gao Shi wanted to repay. In fact, Du Fu also saw how much Goshu Han valued Gao Shi, so he said that Gao Shi would be able to lead the army on his own in about ten years (&ldquo;After ten years out of the shogunate, he can hold the army command.&rdquo;). (Fifteen Rhymes for Gao&rsquo;s Thirty-Five Clerks). In any case, for Gao Shi, who was more than half a century old, this was probably the last chance in his life, and he had to seize it no matter what.</p>
<p>Of course, what neither Gao Shi nor Du Fu expected was that it would not take ten years to take charge of the &ldquo;military command&rdquo; - after only three years, Gao Shi became a knight-errant with a heavy military force.</p>
<p>Reference
^ Regarding the background of Du Fu&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Chariot Line&rdquo;, it is said to be a satire on the use of troops in Qinghai by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, while the other one is a satire on the use of troops in Yunnan by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang.</p>
