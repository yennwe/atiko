  "articleBody": "7\nMarch 16, 1994\nWang Jun had two homes, one in a building and one in a bungalow with a courtyard. He died in the building, the cause of death was taking a lot of sleeping pills.\nThere is nothing much to say about the death scene, except that there are signs of vomiting, the whole body is quite calm.\nBut in the bungalow, we found a lot of things related to the case.\nOne of them was the murder weapon, a masonry hammer with a sawed-off handle and a lot of dried blood stuck to it. At that time, DNA technology was not widespread, so we can only guess that it was the blood of the three victims.\nSecond, we recovered a lot of perverted books and videotapes. The books alone, mostly related to the gods and goddesses, the most vividly remembered, is the book was circled and annotated Liaozhai. There is a story called “dog rape”, Wang Jun even in the next blank, even wrote a few: good!\nOf course, we finally found a worn fox fur coat under his bed, and some furry animal hair, the technicians analyzed, are black dog hair.\nWe speculate that every foggy night, Wang Jun will wear this “fur”, and then the dog hair glued to the face, with this look to the train station to commit crimes.\nBut why is this? We all agree that perhaps with these perverted books and tapes related, especially he was imitating a sperm dog!\nNext, the police did a series of more specific analysis of the motive for the crime: Wang Jun was extremely distorted in his thinking, and the reason why he did it to the first two victims was because they were old and frail, especially one was still stuttering and could not shout when he was killed, and one was lame and would not resist too much.\nAs for killing the pregnant woman, it should be Wang Jun temporary lust. After all, many of his perverted books are incestuous and incestuous things, including scenes depicting the rape and murder of pregnant women.\nAnyway, in the end, the case was well-documented and broken as expected!\nThe police breathed a sigh of relief, and under the Deputy Bureau in charge of criminal investigation, two days later, the police also held a grand celebration banquet.\nFeast personnel, not only the police, but also includes some staff of the railway station, in this ghost case, they have not less effort to cooperate.\nBut to be honest, from the death of Wang Jun, and even until the case is closed, there are still a few people have doubts, including me and Ma Sanshui.\nI talked to Ma Sanshui alone.\nI mean: the ghost case there are many doubts, such as each murder scene on the body, why are so coincidentally there are 11 contusions? Why the killer will burn paper and dance after killing? Especially why each time the scene will be found in the scratched matches?\nMa Sanshui was once stuck. I guess my own questions, but also absolutely put him in a difficult position.\nAnd he, finally answered: “Maybe, it’s all related to Wang Jun’s perversion.”\nThe taste out, he did not have much bottom.\n8\nThe night of the celebration banquet.\nThe scene, simply a mountain of people, the entire restaurant, not only was the venue, but also temporarily added a few tables.\nWe the eyes and ears sat at two tables. In fact, the banquet is this rule, the same kind of people sit a piece, so you can also eat the atmosphere.\nNext to us, is the staff of the train station, but one of them, he did not have a seat.\nIn fact, not really lack of a chair and a pair of chopsticks, mainly because he was disliked, even colleagues, no one likes to sit with him a piece.\nI have an impression of him, called Yu Yanan, is that once very active to provide clues to the station porter.\nHe had a nickname, Yu Monkey! Because of the small size. A big old man, less than one meter six feet tall.\nThis is what I am not used to seeing, seeing him standing alone awkwardly, I waved my hand to him, that means, come to us!\nHe also had a good impression of me, then grinned and nodded.\nWhen he sat down, the bearded man put his arm around him: “Brother, don’t pay attention to those bastards! Old Ge and I will have a good drink with you later, we will not return until we are drunk!”\nYu Yan’an said yes repeatedly.\nBut if you ask me, the beard is too good at making wine.\nWhen the waiter just brought up the Xifeng, beard to everyone filled up, he also first raised a glass, yelled with a loud voice: “Come on, all fucking dry, who does not drink who is this! He also pointed to the crotch of his pants.\nThe result was predictable.\nWhat wine after three rounds, food after five tastes? Not to eat a few bites, there are several eyes and ears slipped out to the table down.\nAlthough Yu Yan’an has not fallen, but already red face, slightly out of shape.\nHe put his arm around me and kept spitting, saying that he was really tired of living, usually carrying work, so he could not breathe, and those colleagues, because they think he is a runt, they look down on him.\nWhat can I say? Only to keep comforting him.\nDuring this period I also noticed his feet. Sitting on the chair, his feet are off the ground, just a swinging wobble.\n“Look, it’s fogging again!” I don’t know who shouted during the meeting.\nEveryone looked out the window, there was a brief moment of silence, and then they all continued to sing and drink.\nThe bearded man wavered and raised his glass again: “A good sign ha! This means the ghost case is really over! Brothers, cheers to this, who does not drink who the grandson!”\nOf course we gave him support, but for a moment, I noticed that Yu Yan’an made an odd movement.\nHe secretly glanced at the fog outside the window and smiled disdainfully.\nI was baffled, I was going to ask some follow-up questions through the wine, but suddenly, I looked at his legs and my heart stuttered.\nI recalled an image of the killer kicking me when the foot was “soft”.\nThis moment, my brain also sweat, are a little sober.\nAfter seeing this scene, the bearded man also laughed, saying that I was weak, to drunk!\nI also feel free to smile, but very hypocritical, completely hard to squeeze out.\n9\nMarch 20, 1994\nThis night was evil, after dark it was foggy, and it was definitely the biggest fog I’ve ever seen in Anding City.\nI held in my heart an idea, and beard revealed. Of course, all pure speculation, now there are many places still do not understand, but spare, the beard listened to almost opened his mouth in surprise.\n“Can’t be? Another Lin over the cloud (eighties rain night butcher)?” He was still a little unconvinced.\nI stressed: “Let’s try it tonight and find out.”\nWe both went to find Yu Yan’an, who was on the job, day and night, for almost nothing.\nWe both found him in the square of the train station. He was wearing overalls and was hustling at the moment.\nTo be frank, this is also a very common phenomenon seen in train stations around the year. Porters to run business, to provide paid services to passengers, in advance to bring on board or carry luggage and so on.\nYu Yan’an was surprised when he saw me and the beard.\n“You guys looking for me?” He took the time to ask.\n“Something good!” Beard replied with a heated smile as he put his arm around him.\nHe listened sparingly, but went with us both to the station.\n“Do the police need people to unload the goods?” He asked again.\nThere was a crash. I suddenly pulled out a match and struck it in his face.\nYu Yan’an glanced at me.\nIn fact, at this time, I was also watching him closely.\nBeard must not feel strong enough, he also came over, and a dozen more at once.\nA ball of fire, in his hands quickly burning.\n“What are you doing?” Yu Yan’an wondered. But listen to the tone of voice, cold a lot.\nThe two of us did not answer positively, and rowed a few more times. “Hey! Looking at this fire, you do not have anything to say? For example ……” beard paused and asked tentatively, “like let’s talk about ghosts?”\nNext, I watched, Yu Yan’an with a change of face.\nHe grinned, smiled oddly, and even shivered a little. Just like that line: struck by electricity, and then shivered like a cold shiver.\nThis is not the same angry Yu Yan’an? He quickly muttered up, saying that the dead cripple, dead stammer, again to bully me, I die rather than his death!\nThe beard and I listened to a confused face.\nAnd Yu Yan’an, he swung his arm, on the momentum to my head smashed.\nBut he forgot, at this time, he did not have a stonework hammer in his hands!\n“Don’t let him slip away!” I reminded the beard.\nThe two of us wanted to one in front of the other, to pin him in the middle, but he dodged, but the hole.\n“Damn, it’s just like a monkey!” Beard spat.\nThen the two of us played the chase with him.\nI don’t know what’s wrong with Yu Yan’an, how can he be so obsessed with the cargo compartment?\nEventually the beard and I chased another cargo compartment, and I was afraid that the last tragedy would happen again, so I stopped the beard that was about to jump inside.\n“What are you doing?” Beard asked.\n“Can you beat him in a single fight?” I asked in return.\n“Just kidding! Who’s the old man? The Big Oil of the North Mountain (prison name) back in the day! Fight him? Heh, count him two together!” The bearded man looked unimpressed, and then he was surprised, “Why do you ask?”\nI patted his shoulder, and pushed him hard into the cargo compartment.\nSee how you Yu monkey still play slippery? I thought of this and pushed the door of the cargo compartment hard from the outside.\nI also patted the door of the cargo compartment, that means, in this way indirectly to the beard drumming up energy.\nNext, I don’t know what happened inside, anyway, when someone tapped the cargo door again, it was two fast and one slow. This is the usual signal for our ears and eyes.\nI pulled it open from the outside.\nBeard carried the semi-conscious Yu Yan’an out like a chicken.\nBut at this time, his head shape is a little messy, even the top is still gray and protruding, hanging a lot of dirt dust ……\n10\nWhen the beard and I got Yu Yan’an back to the police station, that night, I do not know how many people rushed overnight.\nThere are the main police officers of the case, there are also experts, of course, including Ma Sanshui.\nI remember very clearly, he held the profile, standing outside the interrogation room, not a word.\nThis sidebar was also annotated, at first glance dense, there is a kind of messy feeling.\nIn fact, I would like to lament that the profile was once “misleading”, who would have thought that the killer was only 1.6 meters tall? This is a far cry from the 1.7 meters mentioned in the sidebar.\nBut we can’t say that this is an oversight. After all, Yu Yan’an was too cunning to wear height-enhancing growth shoes. To go deeper, his cunning is even more than we expected. Let’s not forget that he also found the perfect scapegoat in Wang Jun.\nThis night, the police tried to pry open Yu Yan’an’s mouth, but now he, almost like a gasbag again, drooping a head, but also can not help but cold words, or he will shrug hair cry.\n“Brother Shui, how about forcing a confession!” Beard suggested.\nMa Sanshui glared at the beard.\nI also immediately winked at the beard. In fact, his starting point is not malicious, but some words, can not be said!\nEventually Yu Yan’an was taken away, I do not know where to go. Afterwards I heard that the police came to several surprise interrogations, and also sent two psychologists involved.\nA clear motive and passage of the crime, a few days later also presented in front of us.\nAnd it must be mentioned that the first thing Yu Yan’an confessed, it was quite a fierce material: he said that in the dry toilet in his yard, buried a dead man.\nWe specifically went there, especially after the toilet was dismantled, and saw the unlucky man.\nHe was almost a white bone, and has been composted by the feces, the smell, as you can imagine.\nThe most important feature of the white bones, is that the legs are disabled, to put it bluntly, was a cripple in life.\nWe quickly gathered information about the white bones. The man’s name is Gao Yong, once the same as Yu Yan’an, a porter at the station. The most important thing, he stammered and leg crippled, more seriously, is considered a disabled person.\nPerhaps the disability makes him psychologically distorted, or his disabled appearance, but also always met with the eyes of others. Anyway, for various reasons, Gao Yong loves to bully Yu Yan’an to take the heat off, after all, Yu Yan’an looks so weak, so weak!\nWhat is the extent of bullying? Not only is the work time, after work he also deliberately go to Yu Yan’an’s home, yelling five drinks six not to say, more let Yu Yan’an to wash his feet and buttocks, all kinds of service to him.\nYu Yan’an also reflected with Wang Jun, after all, Wang Jun is the station manager, but Gao Yong and Wang Jun’s relationship is very good, every time Yu Yan’an reflect the situation, not only the stone sunk into the sea, but will be further tortured and beaten by Gao Yong.\n“You dead monkey! Dare to snitch on me, I’ll cripple you!” This is what Gao Yong likes to say every time.\nYu Yan’an wrote a diary privately, but recorded, in addition to all the things that Gao Yong tortured him, there was also his experience of a lost love.\nTo be honest, the negative energy of this diary is too much, every time you see it, it will evoke the sadness of Yu Yan’an.\nAnd this night, under the fog, Gao Yong, the old bachelor, after drunkenness, actually Yu Yan’an as a woman, “defiled”.\nYu Yan’an broke down and sat alone on the platform, he wanted to die, leaping from the platform. But looking at the train parked on the tracks, such a steel-like behemoth, he was afraid again.\nIf he was run over by the train, he would not be dead! He kept thinking this in his heart.\nAt this moment, I do not know what in the end stimulated him, he struck a match.\nA fire appeared in front of his eyes, and soon went out again.\nIn fact, this also reminds one of a foreign fairy tale: the little girl who sold matches.\nAnyway, under the stimulation of this glowing light, Yu Yan’an bizarre “enlightenment”, the first is a strange thing in his mind.\nThis thing is furry, with wings.\n“Feathered man!” Yu Yan’an immediately associated with it.\nShaanxi, as the location of the ancient capital of the thirteen dynasties, there have been many characteristic cultures passed down here, for example, the feathered man culture is very popular in Anding.\nOn the send old kiln, or in many ancient tombs, will find records about the feathered man. According to archaeologists, the feathered man is a kind of earth immortal with the souls of the dead to ascend to heaven.\nAnd Yu Yan’an brain after the image of the feathered man, and soon emerged another idea: why I die? Gao Yong bullied me, should not he die?\nNext, Yu Yan’an gradually changed, by no means just a sufferer.\nIt was also a rather brutal crime experience.\nYu Yan’an found the opportunity to get Gao Yong drunk, and then use the masonry hammer to cut off the back of his neck.\nWith a bang, Gao Yong’s body was thrown in the shit hole of the dry toilet.\nThis is where Yu Yan’an was smart enough to take advantage of the stench of shit to cover up the stench of Gao Yong’s corpse.\nAs for Gao Yong’s sudden disappearance, Yu Yan’an found an excuse for him to say with the unit, Gao Yong went to sea, went to the south to do business.\nIf placed in the present, this excuse has too many loopholes, but do not forget that in the mid-1990s, under the influence of the wind of reform, countless people have suddenly left without saying goodbye to the unit, “to go to sea to do business. And Gao Yong is just a crippled porter, who would care too much about him?\nThen next, Yu Yanan found that every foggy day, his mood swings are great, as if a demon suddenly appeared in his heart.\n“Perhaps the feathered man possessed, he is helping me to complete the metamorphosis, right?” Yu Yan’an thought so.\nAt the very beginning, he only dressed himself up as half human, half ghost and went to wander inside the train station. After all, doing so could make him “comfortable” and suppress all kinds of weird thoughts in his mind.\nBut gradually, he found that he could not control himself at all. Every foggy day, once he was left alone, an evil thought that scratched his ears would pop up.\nHe started killing people as a result. Under the guise of a porter, he would ask the passengers if they wanted to get on the train early, then swindle them to a remote place, then go down with a hammer, and when the victim fell down, he would dress himself up as a feathered man again and start the next dance and paper burning, etc.\nHe also had specific targets: the welder, who was killed because he stammered and made Yu Yan’an think of Gao Yong; the kang bun vendor, who was crippled like Gao Yong, so he was brutally murdered.\nAs for the last female victim, the reason she was killed is even more breathless.\nShe has a beauty mole on her chin, once abandoned Yu Yan’an’s girlfriend, also has this one mole.\nWhen killing the first two people, Yu Yan’an was once confused. He explained to the police that he felt at the time that he had clearly killed Gao Yong, but why was it a stranger when he later took a closer look?\n“It must be an illusion!” He soothed himself, but also in order to be able to identify the dead is Gao Yong, he simply stripped off the dead man’s autumn pants, over the head of the dead.\n“This is Gao Yong!” He looked at the body kneeling on the ground and kept nodding his head.\nAs for why there were 11 contusions. Yu Yan’an’s explanation was that Gao Yong had defiled him a total of 11 times before and after.\nSo he wanted revenge by making Gao Yong kneel on the ground and kowtow to atone for his sins, after which he hammered Gao Yong eleven more times!\nThe female victim was different, in addition to the 11 contusions on the brain, the stomach was also hammered once.\nYu Yan’an’s explanation: he was particularly hateful, because the “girlfriend” was pregnant with someone else, so he habitually hammered the female victim’s head 11 times, and then the belly to a fierce hammer. He wanted to hammer the child to death!\nThe police finally asked Yu Yan’an about burning paper and dancing: Why would he do that? Is it a sacrifice to the feathered man inside him? Because the feathered man gave him strength.\nIt is said that Yu monkey broke down on the spot, as if dead, staring with big eyes and not talking. The police were so frightened that they almost called a doctor, but suddenly, Yu Yanan slowed down again.\nHe said he didn’t like the feathered man inside him at all, because it was too dominant and too controlling. At that time, after killing people, he looked at the scene of the murder, once blamed himself and regret, but the next moment, he was a new person in general, want to sing and dance.\nSo he wanted to send the feathered man away by burning paper, during which he also struck a match, hoping that the firelight would also help him, after all, in the earliest days, the feathered man was in the firelight. He thought that the feathered man might be able to leave in the light of the fire.\nBut, inviting “God” is easy to send “God” is difficult!\n11\nIn response to Yu Yan’an’s confession. We also discussed it in private.\nTo be honest, I don’t know where to put Yu Yan’an, is he an unforgivable person? Or is he himself a victim and somewhat justifiable?\nAnd what does the beard mean: this Yu monkey definitely has a mental illness, bullied by Gao Yong, from the night of the first sodomy began to commit the disease, and then as time goes by, the disease is getting worse.\nAs for Ma Sanshui, what he said seemed very formal.\nHe also mentioned a term: criminal psychological arousal. A weak person, when really pushed to a dead end, under the stimulation of certain specific occasions or circumstances, he will develop hysteria. If this hysteria is not aggressive, then it is appropriate to call it a mental illness. But once driven by hysteria, he began to kill or commit crimes, it is not only pathological, but more should be called the emergence of hysterical criminal personality.\nI repeatedly tasted Ma Sanshui’s words.\nMa Sanshui lamented again, saying that Yu Yan’an has been splitting out of the new personality as a feathered man, but the good thing is that it is only the initial stage, otherwise really wait for the “feathered man” to fatten up, it will completely replace Yu Yan’an, then there will be more innocent people were killed!\n12\nPostscript\nBefore he was sentenced, Yu Yan’an was sent to a detention center.\nIt is said that he became more and more eccentric at that time, and it seemed that the Yu monkey, itself, was gradually disappearing.\nIn the detention center, Yu Yan’an was also particularly fond of babbling nonsense.\nOne of his favorite things to say was that a rabbit had killed a man and escaped into the forest. The police could not do anything about the rabbit, whether they sent experts to analyze it or got police officers to search the mountain, but they could not find it.\nWhat did the police do in the end? They caught a bear, when the police dragged the bear out of the forest, the bear was bruised and swollen, are crying.\nThe bear cried and said, “Stop fighting, I’m a rabbit!”\nYu Yan’an was particularly self-indulgent, and every time he finished, he clapped his hands and laughed for a while.\nAt that time when the beard and I heard about this, the beard directly spat: “stupid than!”\nAnd I, a soft sigh: “Poor rabbit!”\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>7</p>
<p>March 16, 1994</p>
<p>Wang Jun had two homes, one in a building and one in a bungalow with a courtyard. He died in the building, the cause of death was taking a lot of sleeping pills.</p>
<p>There is nothing much to say about the death scene, except that there are signs of vomiting, the whole body is quite calm.</p>
<p>But in the bungalow, we found a lot of things related to the case.</p>
<p>One of them was the murder weapon, a masonry hammer with a sawed-off handle and a lot of dried blood stuck to it. At that time, DNA technology was not widespread, so we can only guess that it was the blood of the three victims.</p>
<p>Second, we recovered a lot of perverted books and videotapes. The books alone, mostly related to the gods and goddesses, the most vividly remembered, is the book was circled and annotated Liaozhai. There is a story called &ldquo;dog rape&rdquo;, Wang Jun even in the next blank, even wrote a few: good!</p>
<p>Of course, we finally found a worn fox fur coat under his bed, and some furry animal hair, the technicians analyzed, are black dog hair.</p>
<p>We speculate that every foggy night, Wang Jun will wear this &ldquo;fur&rdquo;, and then the dog hair glued to the face, with this look to the train station to commit crimes.</p>
<p>But why is this? We all agree that perhaps with these perverted books and tapes related, especially he was imitating a sperm dog!</p>
<p>Next, the police did a series of more specific analysis of the motive for the crime: Wang Jun was extremely distorted in his thinking, and the reason why he did it to the first two victims was because they were old and frail, especially one was still stuttering and could not shout when he was killed, and one was lame and would not resist too much.</p>
<p>As for killing the pregnant woman, it should be Wang Jun temporary lust. After all, many of his perverted books are incestuous and incestuous things, including scenes depicting the rape and murder of pregnant women.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the end, the case was well-documented and broken as expected!</p>
<p>The police breathed a sigh of relief, and under the Deputy Bureau in charge of criminal investigation, two days later, the police also held a grand celebration banquet.</p>
<p>Feast personnel, not only the police, but also includes some staff of the railway station, in this ghost case, they have not less effort to cooperate.</p>
<p>But to be honest, from the death of Wang Jun, and even until the case is closed, there are still a few people have doubts, including me and Ma Sanshui.</p>
<p>I talked to Ma Sanshui alone.</p>
<p>I mean: the ghost case there are many doubts, such as each murder scene on the body, why are so coincidentally there are 11 contusions? Why the killer will burn paper and dance after killing? Especially why each time the scene will be found in the scratched matches?</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui was once stuck. I guess my own questions, but also absolutely put him in a difficult position.</p>
<p>And he, finally answered: &ldquo;Maybe, it&rsquo;s all related to Wang Jun&rsquo;s perversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taste out, he did not have much bottom.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>The night of the celebration banquet.</p>
<p>The scene, simply a mountain of people, the entire restaurant, not only was the venue, but also temporarily added a few tables.</p>
<p>We the eyes and ears sat at two tables. In fact, the banquet is this rule, the same kind of people sit a piece, so you can also eat the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Next to us, is the staff of the train station, but one of them, he did not have a seat.</p>
<p>In fact, not really lack of a chair and a pair of chopsticks, mainly because he was disliked, even colleagues, no one likes to sit with him a piece.</p>
<p>I have an impression of him, called Yu Yanan, is that once very active to provide clues to the station porter.</p>
<p>He had a nickname, Yu Monkey! Because of the small size. A big old man, less than one meter six feet tall.</p>
<p>This is what I am not used to seeing, seeing him standing alone awkwardly, I waved my hand to him, that means, come to us!</p>
<p>He also had a good impression of me, then grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>When he sat down, the bearded man put his arm around him: &ldquo;Brother, don&rsquo;t pay attention to those bastards! Old Ge and I will have a good drink with you later, we will not return until we are drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an said yes repeatedly.</p>
<p>But if you ask me, the beard is too good at making wine.</p>
<p>When the waiter just brought up the Xifeng, beard to everyone filled up, he also first raised a glass, yelled with a loud voice: &ldquo;Come on, all fucking dry, who does not drink who is this! He also pointed to the crotch of his pants.</p>
<p>The result was predictable.</p>
<p>What wine after three rounds, food after five tastes? Not to eat a few bites, there are several eyes and ears slipped out to the table down.</p>
<p>Although Yu Yan&rsquo;an has not fallen, but already red face, slightly out of shape.</p>
<p>He put his arm around me and kept spitting, saying that he was really tired of living, usually carrying work, so he could not breathe, and those colleagues, because they think he is a runt, they look down on him.</p>
<p>What can I say? Only to keep comforting him.</p>
<p>During this period I also noticed his feet. Sitting on the chair, his feet are off the ground, just a swinging wobble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s fogging again!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know who shouted during the meeting.</p>
<p>Everyone looked out the window, there was a brief moment of silence, and then they all continued to sing and drink.</p>
<p>The bearded man wavered and raised his glass again: &ldquo;A good sign ha! This means the ghost case is really over! Brothers, cheers to this, who does not drink who the grandson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we gave him support, but for a moment, I noticed that Yu Yan&rsquo;an made an odd movement.</p>
<p>He secretly glanced at the fog outside the window and smiled disdainfully.</p>
<p>I was baffled, I was going to ask some follow-up questions through the wine, but suddenly, I looked at his legs and my heart stuttered.</p>
<p>I recalled an image of the killer kicking me when the foot was &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This moment, my brain also sweat, are a little sober.</p>
<p>After seeing this scene, the bearded man also laughed, saying that I was weak, to drunk!</p>
<p>I also feel free to smile, but very hypocritical, completely hard to squeeze out.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>March 20, 1994</p>
<p>This night was evil, after dark it was foggy, and it was definitely the biggest fog I&rsquo;ve ever seen in Anding City.</p>
<p>I held in my heart an idea, and beard revealed. Of course, all pure speculation, now there are many places still do not understand, but spare, the beard listened to almost opened his mouth in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be? Another Lin over the cloud (eighties rain night butcher)?&rdquo; He was still a little unconvinced.</p>
<p>I stressed: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it tonight and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both went to find Yu Yan&rsquo;an, who was on the job, day and night, for almost nothing.</p>
<p>We both found him in the square of the train station. He was wearing overalls and was hustling at the moment.</p>
<p>To be frank, this is also a very common phenomenon seen in train stations around the year. Porters to run business, to provide paid services to passengers, in advance to bring on board or carry luggage and so on.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an was surprised when he saw me and the beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys looking for me?&rdquo; He took the time to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something good!&rdquo; Beard replied with a heated smile as he put his arm around him.</p>
<p>He listened sparingly, but went with us both to the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the police need people to unload the goods?&rdquo; He asked again.</p>
<p>There was a crash. I suddenly pulled out a match and struck it in his face.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an glanced at me.</p>
<p>In fact, at this time, I was also watching him closely.</p>
<p>Beard must not feel strong enough, he also came over, and a dozen more at once.</p>
<p>A ball of fire, in his hands quickly burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Yu Yan&rsquo;an wondered. But listen to the tone of voice, cold a lot.</p>
<p>The two of us did not answer positively, and rowed a few more times. &ldquo;Hey! Looking at this fire, you do not have anything to say? For example &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; beard paused and asked tentatively, &ldquo;like let&rsquo;s talk about ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, I watched, Yu Yan&rsquo;an with a change of face.</p>
<p>He grinned, smiled oddly, and even shivered a little. Just like that line: struck by electricity, and then shivered like a cold shiver.</p>
<p>This is not the same angry Yu Yan&rsquo;an? He quickly muttered up, saying that the dead cripple, dead stammer, again to bully me, I die rather than his death!</p>
<p>The beard and I listened to a confused face.</p>
<p>And Yu Yan&rsquo;an, he swung his arm, on the momentum to my head smashed.</p>
<p>But he forgot, at this time, he did not have a stonework hammer in his hands!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him slip away!&rdquo; I reminded the beard.</p>
<p>The two of us wanted to one in front of the other, to pin him in the middle, but he dodged, but the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, it&rsquo;s just like a monkey!&rdquo; Beard spat.</p>
<p>Then the two of us played the chase with him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with Yu Yan&rsquo;an, how can he be so obsessed with the cargo compartment?</p>
<p>Eventually the beard and I chased another cargo compartment, and I was afraid that the last tragedy would happen again, so I stopped the beard that was about to jump inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Beard asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat him in a single fight?&rdquo; I asked in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just kidding! Who&rsquo;s the old man? The Big Oil of the North Mountain (prison name) back in the day! Fight him? Heh, count him two together!&rdquo; The bearded man looked unimpressed, and then he was surprised, &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I patted his shoulder, and pushed him hard into the cargo compartment.</p>
<p>See how you Yu monkey still play slippery? I thought of this and pushed the door of the cargo compartment hard from the outside.</p>
<p>I also patted the door of the cargo compartment, that means, in this way indirectly to the beard drumming up energy.</p>
<p>Next, I don&rsquo;t know what happened inside, anyway, when someone tapped the cargo door again, it was two fast and one slow. This is the usual signal for our ears and eyes.</p>
<p>I pulled it open from the outside.</p>
<p>Beard carried the semi-conscious Yu Yan&rsquo;an out like a chicken.</p>
<p>But at this time, his head shape is a little messy, even the top is still gray and protruding, hanging a lot of dirt dust &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>When the beard and I got Yu Yan&rsquo;an back to the police station, that night, I do not know how many people rushed overnight.</p>
<p>There are the main police officers of the case, there are also experts, of course, including Ma Sanshui.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly, he held the profile, standing outside the interrogation room, not a word.</p>
<p>This sidebar was also annotated, at first glance dense, there is a kind of messy feeling.</p>
<p>In fact, I would like to lament that the profile was once &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;, who would have thought that the killer was only 1.6 meters tall? This is a far cry from the 1.7 meters mentioned in the sidebar.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t say that this is an oversight. After all, Yu Yan&rsquo;an was too cunning to wear height-enhancing growth shoes. To go deeper, his cunning is even more than we expected. Let&rsquo;s not forget that he also found the perfect scapegoat in Wang Jun.</p>
<p>This night, the police tried to pry open Yu Yan&rsquo;an&rsquo;s mouth, but now he, almost like a gasbag again, drooping a head, but also can not help but cold words, or he will shrug hair cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Shui, how about forcing a confession!&rdquo; Beard suggested.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui glared at the beard.</p>
<p>I also immediately winked at the beard. In fact, his starting point is not malicious, but some words, can not be said!</p>
<p>Eventually Yu Yan&rsquo;an was taken away, I do not know where to go. Afterwards I heard that the police came to several surprise interrogations, and also sent two psychologists involved.</p>
<p>A clear motive and passage of the crime, a few days later also presented in front of us.</p>
<p>And it must be mentioned that the first thing Yu Yan&rsquo;an confessed, it was quite a fierce material: he said that in the dry toilet in his yard, buried a dead man.</p>
<p>We specifically went there, especially after the toilet was dismantled, and saw the unlucky man.</p>
<p>He was almost a white bone, and has been composted by the feces, the smell, as you can imagine.</p>
<p>The most important feature of the white bones, is that the legs are disabled, to put it bluntly, was a cripple in life.</p>
<p>We quickly gathered information about the white bones. The man&rsquo;s name is Gao Yong, once the same as Yu Yan&rsquo;an, a porter at the station. The most important thing, he stammered and leg crippled, more seriously, is considered a disabled person.</p>
<p>Perhaps the disability makes him psychologically distorted, or his disabled appearance, but also always met with the eyes of others. Anyway, for various reasons, Gao Yong loves to bully Yu Yan&rsquo;an to take the heat off, after all, Yu Yan&rsquo;an looks so weak, so weak!</p>
<p>What is the extent of bullying? Not only is the work time, after work he also deliberately go to Yu Yan&rsquo;an&rsquo;s home, yelling five drinks six not to say, more let Yu Yan&rsquo;an to wash his feet and buttocks, all kinds of service to him.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an also reflected with Wang Jun, after all, Wang Jun is the station manager, but Gao Yong and Wang Jun&rsquo;s relationship is very good, every time Yu Yan&rsquo;an reflect the situation, not only the stone sunk into the sea, but will be further tortured and beaten by Gao Yong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dead monkey! Dare to snitch on me, I&rsquo;ll cripple you!&rdquo; This is what Gao Yong likes to say every time.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an wrote a diary privately, but recorded, in addition to all the things that Gao Yong tortured him, there was also his experience of a lost love.</p>
<p>To be honest, the negative energy of this diary is too much, every time you see it, it will evoke the sadness of Yu Yan&rsquo;an.</p>
<p>And this night, under the fog, Gao Yong, the old bachelor, after drunkenness, actually Yu Yan&rsquo;an as a woman, &ldquo;defiled&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an broke down and sat alone on the platform, he wanted to die, leaping from the platform. But looking at the train parked on the tracks, such a steel-like behemoth, he was afraid again.</p>
<p>If he was run over by the train, he would not be dead! He kept thinking this in his heart.</p>
<p>At this moment, I do not know what in the end stimulated him, he struck a match.</p>
<p>A fire appeared in front of his eyes, and soon went out again.</p>
<p>In fact, this also reminds one of a foreign fairy tale: the little girl who sold matches.</p>
<p>Anyway, under the stimulation of this glowing light, Yu Yan&rsquo;an bizarre &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo;, the first is a strange thing in his mind.</p>
<p>This thing is furry, with wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feathered man!&rdquo; Yu Yan&rsquo;an immediately associated with it.</p>
<p>Shaanxi, as the location of the ancient capital of the thirteen dynasties, there have been many characteristic cultures passed down here, for example, the feathered man culture is very popular in Anding.</p>
<p>On the send old kiln, or in many ancient tombs, will find records about the feathered man. According to archaeologists, the feathered man is a kind of earth immortal with the souls of the dead to ascend to heaven.</p>
<p>And Yu Yan&rsquo;an brain after the image of the feathered man, and soon emerged another idea: why I die? Gao Yong bullied me, should not he die?</p>
<p>Next, Yu Yan&rsquo;an gradually changed, by no means just a sufferer.</p>
<p>It was also a rather brutal crime experience.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an found the opportunity to get Gao Yong drunk, and then use the masonry hammer to cut off the back of his neck.</p>
<p>With a bang, Gao Yong&rsquo;s body was thrown in the shit hole of the dry toilet.</p>
<p>This is where Yu Yan&rsquo;an was smart enough to take advantage of the stench of shit to cover up the stench of Gao Yong&rsquo;s corpse.</p>
<p>As for Gao Yong&rsquo;s sudden disappearance, Yu Yan&rsquo;an found an excuse for him to say with the unit, Gao Yong went to sea, went to the south to do business.</p>
<p>If placed in the present, this excuse has too many loopholes, but do not forget that in the mid-1990s, under the influence of the wind of reform, countless people have suddenly left without saying goodbye to the unit, &ldquo;to go to sea to do business. And Gao Yong is just a crippled porter, who would care too much about him?</p>
<p>Then next, Yu Yanan found that every foggy day, his mood swings are great, as if a demon suddenly appeared in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the feathered man possessed, he is helping me to complete the metamorphosis, right?&rdquo; Yu Yan&rsquo;an thought so.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, he only dressed himself up as half human, half ghost and went to wander inside the train station. After all, doing so could make him &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; and suppress all kinds of weird thoughts in his mind.</p>
<p>But gradually, he found that he could not control himself at all. Every foggy day, once he was left alone, an evil thought that scratched his ears would pop up.</p>
<p>He started killing people as a result. Under the guise of a porter, he would ask the passengers if they wanted to get on the train early, then swindle them to a remote place, then go down with a hammer, and when the victim fell down, he would dress himself up as a feathered man again and start the next dance and paper burning, etc.</p>
<p>He also had specific targets: the welder, who was killed because he stammered and made Yu Yan&rsquo;an think of Gao Yong; the kang bun vendor, who was crippled like Gao Yong, so he was brutally murdered.</p>
<p>As for the last female victim, the reason she was killed is even more breathless.</p>
<p>She has a beauty mole on her chin, once abandoned Yu Yan&rsquo;an&rsquo;s girlfriend, also has this one mole.</p>
<p>When killing the first two people, Yu Yan&rsquo;an was once confused. He explained to the police that he felt at the time that he had clearly killed Gao Yong, but why was it a stranger when he later took a closer look?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be an illusion!&rdquo; He soothed himself, but also in order to be able to identify the dead is Gao Yong, he simply stripped off the dead man&rsquo;s autumn pants, over the head of the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Gao Yong!&rdquo; He looked at the body kneeling on the ground and kept nodding his head.</p>
<p>As for why there were 11 contusions. Yu Yan&rsquo;an&rsquo;s explanation was that Gao Yong had defiled him a total of 11 times before and after.</p>
<p>So he wanted revenge by making Gao Yong kneel on the ground and kowtow to atone for his sins, after which he hammered Gao Yong eleven more times!</p>
<p>The female victim was different, in addition to the 11 contusions on the brain, the stomach was also hammered once.</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an&rsquo;s explanation: he was particularly hateful, because the &ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo; was pregnant with someone else, so he habitually hammered the female victim&rsquo;s head 11 times, and then the belly to a fierce hammer. He wanted to hammer the child to death!</p>
<p>The police finally asked Yu Yan&rsquo;an about burning paper and dancing: Why would he do that? Is it a sacrifice to the feathered man inside him? Because the feathered man gave him strength.</p>
<p>It is said that Yu monkey broke down on the spot, as if dead, staring with big eyes and not talking. The police were so frightened that they almost called a doctor, but suddenly, Yu Yanan slowed down again.</p>
<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t like the feathered man inside him at all, because it was too dominant and too controlling. At that time, after killing people, he looked at the scene of the murder, once blamed himself and regret, but the next moment, he was a new person in general, want to sing and dance.</p>
<p>So he wanted to send the feathered man away by burning paper, during which he also struck a match, hoping that the firelight would also help him, after all, in the earliest days, the feathered man was in the firelight. He thought that the feathered man might be able to leave in the light of the fire.</p>
<p>But, inviting &ldquo;God&rdquo; is easy to send &ldquo;God&rdquo; is difficult!</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>In response to Yu Yan&rsquo;an&rsquo;s confession. We also discussed it in private.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know where to put Yu Yan&rsquo;an, is he an unforgivable person? Or is he himself a victim and somewhat justifiable?</p>
<p>And what does the beard mean: this Yu monkey definitely has a mental illness, bullied by Gao Yong, from the night of the first sodomy began to commit the disease, and then as time goes by, the disease is getting worse.</p>
<p>As for Ma Sanshui, what he said seemed very formal.</p>
<p>He also mentioned a term: criminal psychological arousal. A weak person, when really pushed to a dead end, under the stimulation of certain specific occasions or circumstances, he will develop hysteria. If this hysteria is not aggressive, then it is appropriate to call it a mental illness. But once driven by hysteria, he began to kill or commit crimes, it is not only pathological, but more should be called the emergence of hysterical criminal personality.</p>
<p>I repeatedly tasted Ma Sanshui&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Ma Sanshui lamented again, saying that Yu Yan&rsquo;an has been splitting out of the new personality as a feathered man, but the good thing is that it is only the initial stage, otherwise really wait for the &ldquo;feathered man&rdquo; to fatten up, it will completely replace Yu Yan&rsquo;an, then there will be more innocent people were killed!</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>Before he was sentenced, Yu Yan&rsquo;an was sent to a detention center.</p>
<p>It is said that he became more and more eccentric at that time, and it seemed that the Yu monkey, itself, was gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>In the detention center, Yu Yan&rsquo;an was also particularly fond of babbling nonsense.</p>
<p>One of his favorite things to say was that a rabbit had killed a man and escaped into the forest. The police could not do anything about the rabbit, whether they sent experts to analyze it or got police officers to search the mountain, but they could not find it.</p>
<p>What did the police do in the end? They caught a bear, when the police dragged the bear out of the forest, the bear was bruised and swollen, are crying.</p>
<p>The bear cried and said, &ldquo;Stop fighting, I&rsquo;m a rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yu Yan&rsquo;an was particularly self-indulgent, and every time he finished, he clapped his hands and laughed for a while.</p>
<p>At that time when the beard and I heard about this, the beard directly spat: &ldquo;stupid than!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I, a soft sigh: &ldquo;Poor rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
