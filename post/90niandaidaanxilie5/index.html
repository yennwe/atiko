  "articleBody": " I wiggled up frantically. This caught the attention of the killer, Zhang Jianjun.\nHe temporarily turned off the intercom and asked me again, “Where are you not feeling well? Do you want to sleep again.”\nAfter saying that, he took out a pocket, took out a plastic bag, which was sealed with a white handkerchief.\nWhich I do not understand, immediately shook his head.\n“Then what did you just wave?” He cursed.\nI thought to myself that this is called a wave? But I remembered what the master psychologist had said earlier. The killer’s mind is twisted, not the same as normal people, with his own set of theories, so this kind of people, or not to contradict him for the better.\nI forced down my heart all sorts of uneasiness, as gentle as possible, with him again shaking his head to show.\nI didn’t expect a good effect. He walked up to me and tore a piece of tape off my mouth.\n“What are you doing?” He at least didn’t curse anymore, but took the initiative to ask me.\nI stared at the intercom and looked at him again. “I haven’t shown my face in a long time, and if I keep this up, someone will get suspicious!”\nHe came up with a thoughtful look.\n“I know the rules and won’t talk nonsense, just let me show my face here (on the walkie-talkie)!” I gestured.\nHe finally agreed and put the walkie-talkie in front of my mouth, but at the same time, he also raised the iron hook so that the tip of the hook was pointed at my eyes.\n“Don’t mess up, okay?” He warned with a serious look on his face.\nI nodded my head.\nWhen he turned on the intercom, I remained staring at him, which was actually a little trick; I was steadying him with my eyes and my own expression. “Guys, stop talking nonsense and get down to business. Ahem!” At the end, I pointed my voice and coughed.\nThe killer hastily turned off the intercom.\n“You got a cold?” He asked.\nI deliberately put on a hard face and nodded in gesture.\nAlso have to be thankful that the killer did not find the end. And at this point, what I wanted most was for the beard to understand what I really meant.\nJust before, when the murderer talked to everyone on the intercom, I secretly observed the scene outside the window.\nDirectly outside the window was a crooked-necked tree. This is simply too marked.\nThere is a dumpling restaurant in Baoshan County that sells dumplings named a tree! The reason is simple, there is a crooked-necked tree growing in the house of this store.\nAt the time, the store owner had someone look at it and said it was a fortune tree, so not only did not cut, and eventually became its sign.\nBeard and I went to this dumpling store to eat many times. Originally the dumplings are really quite delicious, but the beard and I complained, saying that the waiter here is too unqualified, coughing when serving, that is not her saliva, all sprayed on the dumplings?\nI reassured him then, out of sight, out of mind!\nAnd that cough I just made was imitating the waitress.\nIf he was smart, he would have guessed that I was now in trouble and imprisoned near the “one tree”.\n“Come on, beard!” I kept praying.\nI don’t know what the murderer’s purpose was in capturing me in the first place, but for now, he wasn’t trying to kill me, but to talk to me.\nThis is also attributed to my “enthusiasm”.\nI have an attitude: don’t contradict, go along with him, in order to buy all the time!\nI suspect he hadn’t spoken to anyone in a long time, so when he opened his mouth, he simply became a talker.\nHe first did a round of emotions: “Why is there so much unfairness in this world? Some people are born with a golden spoon, while others are born with a disability and are abandoned by their families, why is that so?\nIf someone is just born to be treacherous and lazy and gluttonous, and therefore abandoned, that also makes people have nothing to say, but those demented people, they do not even have a chance to struggle, why is it so unfair?”\nThen he asked me in all seriousness: “Aren’t we socialists? Aren’t we eating a big pot of rice and there is no difference between the rich and the poor? But why doesn’t anyone care about them (the demented)?”\nIf I were someone else, or if I were free now, I would have told the truth, which is not a bull’s-eye or what?\nBut in order to prevent provoking him, I deliberately nodded seriously and responded, “You have a point!”\nThe killer sighed again and sat down next to me in exhaustion.\n“You know what? I wanted to help them so much, even stay with them, ask for food together, and also bring all the good things I have, to them, but it’s no use! They’ll never be well.”\nI was right, the murderer’s eyes were red. This murderer, to his surprise, was crying.\n“They are animals!” He also choked up.\nI saw it with my own eyes, otherwise I would never have believed that the word beast coming out of his mouth was not a derogatory word at all.\nI also suddenly particularly helpless, thinking back, when we all saw the handwriting at the scene, who would have thought that the word beast, this meaning?\nI adjusted my mood and interjected again tentatively, “You played them the tape because you wanted to cure them?”\nThe killer smiled bitterly. I took this as a reply.\nBut the boy turned over his face faster than a book. All of a sudden, his anger was so strong: “That fake, thanks to his name Zhang Jianjun! Is he worthy of it! I worshipped this qigong master with the same name as me and had high hopes, but he lied to me! Especially that poor guy (the first deceased), after he heard the tape, he actually disliked me, saying that I was not good to him and let him listen to this kind of disgusting baloney!”\n“So you killed this guy?” I asked.\n“It was relief! I didn’t want him to suffer so much anymore, like a beast. Since I can’t find a cure anymore, instead of that, I’ll use my way and give him a relief.”\nHe even gestured up at this point: “Cut off the head, this thing is bad, so don’t want it. As for the body, hang them up and let them ascend to heaven. I believe they will be reincarnated in the next life! Don’t you think so?”\nI actually wanted to vomit and felt disgusted by his twisted thinking, but I couldn’t help it, I played hard to calm down and nodded “hypocritically”.\nNext he kept cursing the qigong master named Zhang Jianjun.\nI also understood that the reason he buried the murder weapon and human head in the yard of the qigong master, is to “tell” the qigong master one thing: his qigong useless, and the bad thing (head), he also disliked, simply give the qigong master.\nI counted in my heart that the master had disappeared for half a month. Although the current look, he is more than lucky, but I still asked: “Do you know where that Zhang Jianjun went?”\nThe killer patted my shoulder, as if to say, you asked a very good question!\nHe replied, “I know the police are taking good care of him. But I found an opportunity to take him captive. Originally I told him that people are not afraid to make mistakes, as long as they can repent. So I asked him to come with me to ‘help’ demented people, but I never thought he would dare to resist such a good advice from me. Especially after originally agreeing to it for three days, he suddenly backtracked. Thanks to me for treating him as a friend and giving him the good stuff! This liar who is not what he seems, so I later decided, again, to tie a stone to his feet and throw him in the pond to feed the fish. This kind of person, not worthy of ascension, or feed the fish, at least the fish have grown fat, we eat when there is a mouthful of well!”\nSpeaking of this, he looked at me again, took out a face confused expression: “I finally left a note, specifically told you ah, that Zhang Jianjun is in the pond. But I look at the news and newspapers in the past few days, why there is Zhang Jianjun’s search notice? So that night, I went back to look at it, I did not expect ……”\nHe covered his mouth and laughed: “You guys even used the pump to pump the pond. Really stupid, at that time I deliberately left a blood trail, so that it extends to the pond. In fact, you guys just need to cast a net there and fish a few times, you will be able to find Zhang Jianjun’s body, well …… maybe it has turned into a skeleton. Also the heads of the three ascendants, all bad stuff anyway! All were left there by me. Actually fished up really effortlessly!”\nI listened frozen. Also recalled the picture at the scene of the crime, the note that said: come find me, Zhang Jianjun!\nBut who would have thought that the meaning of this note is so.\nThe next half an hour, I continued to chat along with the killer. And he, in fact, more and more favorable to me, and even come up with a look of regret, saying that it would be good to know me early, because he and I are in many ways heroes where slightly the same.\nI smiled on the surface, but in my heart there is a feeling of crying, there is a moment, I dislike myself a little, said with this kind of person like-minded.\nAnd this kind of acting against your will, very painful. If the beard did not appear, I do not know how long I can hold on ……\nSuddenly, the house door was kicked open.\nIn fact, the killer reacted quickly, the moment the door was broken, he bounced up like a panther.\nAs for me, I also seized this one opportunity. Although they are tied, but do not forget that the mouth is not sealed.\nWhat time is it, what are the rules? I leaned forward with all my might and bit his wrist holding the iron hook.\n“Bastard!” He cursed in pain, and kicked me hard.\nLike a potato, I rolled to the side. But such a delay bought time for the beard who took the brunt of the attack.\n“Damn it, dare to hit the old leather!” He cursed and lunged forward.\nI was worried that he would not lose, after all, the killer had a weapon. But this worry seems superfluous.\nWho was Beard? Once the prison’s big oil!\nNot a few moves it, the beard will ride the murderer in the crotch, that is, I shouted in time, otherwise the beard’s fist, certainly hit the murderer’s right temple.\nIt is clear that the beard for me, this time to death!\nBut in the end, the murderer’s neck swelled up a cut, he also completely fainted.\nThe bearded man’s body lurched and slid off the murderer.\nHe looked at me, and I looked at him.\nHe deliberately coughed and he laughed.\nAugust 15, 1993.\nIt lasted a whole month and a half before the case was finally solved.\nBut the beard and I did not have the opportunity to participate in its follow-up, when Yunnan staged a major event, the local police force is insufficient, the police asked for help from the provinces.\nThe two of us were arranged by Ma Sanshui, rushed to Yunnan overnight.\nI guess many people have heard of that case later, known as the “black man hotel series of murders”.\nThat case, not here to describe one by one, but the case of Zhang Jianjun, I later listened to other eyes and ears and introduced some of the situation. It is said that Zhang Jianjun, this person, since childhood, has a “temper”, playing games with his friends, everyone must listen to him, regardless of what he said right or wrong, or he will not be happy, and even fight with those who do not obey.\nAfter elementary school, there was an art class, the teacher asked everyone to draw a horse, Zhang Jianjun actually drew a thing that was not a cow or a horse, the teacher said he was wrong, he retorted in class, saying that this was the horse in his heart. Finally, when everyone in the class laughed at him, he was so angry that he tore up the painting that he had drawn for one class.\nAt the age of 18, Zhang Jianjun was in the army. In fact, he is a soldier material, all aspects are outstanding, even the instructor evaluation, he is suitable for special forces.\nThe problem is, he also has a shortcoming, not only do not obey orders, but also always looking for instructors to ask some strange and bizarre questions. For example, what he couldn’t understand was: why are there so many people becoming soldiers? Now there is no war, the soldiers only drill every day, what a waste of manpower? Why don’t we cut back and send most of the soldiers home and let them serve the community?\nIn fact, his eccentric thinking since childhood, but also destined to his path is increasingly narrow. Especially after he changed jobs from the military, he was further isolated.\nHe has changed many jobs, basically for his own personal reasons. Because of this, he always felt that he was being unfairly treated, and even this view was, step by step, amplified to demented people.\nHe became more and more sympathetic to the demented person, and with his distorted thinking, he also wanted to make the demented person live a normal life again with his own efforts. For example, take the demented person to seek medical treatment. But this brain disease, how can be cured?\nFinally, he put his hope on the qigong masters, especially in Baoshan County, there is a qigong master with the same name as him, this person is very famous, and even some tabloid news that this person has also cured cancer.\nZhang Jianjun for this reason, writing letters, trying to visit, etc., but the master, a face of superiority and arrogance, simply do not see him. Finally Zhang Jianjun could only buy tapes, after all, the qigong master said, the tape with his gong power, can also cure the disease.\nAnd the next early one morning, looking at the demented person did not get better at all, Zhang Jianjun completely disappointed, under the influence of distorted thinking, he also used his own method, the demented person freed, went to heaven ……\nAbout this person, Zhang Jianjun, after my beard and I went to Yunnan, we also had several private discussions.\nOf course, in addition to discussing him, we also play on the topic, and finally talk about “fairness”. After all, Zhang Jianjun before being shot, are shouting, saying that this society is unfair to him!\nHu Zi does not like to hide, expressed his views: “What do you mean by fairness? What do you mean by unfair? In fact, there is no absolute fairness? Like us, we made a big mistake back then, and now in order to cleanse the soul of the last dirty soil, so become the eyes and ears, almost every day to face, to do with criminals and life and death struggle. In fact, is it easy for us? Is it fair to us? When the mistake was made before, if there is a person to pull us a hand, let us hang on the horse, it will not follow so nagging? But ……”\nThe beard thought of what, suddenly happy ha ha laughed: “I still say, this society is good, and will get better and better, but anyone who is born in this world, but also have to be prepared for a psychological. No matter where in this world, there is no absolute fairness, so do not give up the right to live because of ‘unfairness’, and we should not give up the pursuit of happiness because of it.”\nLook at the beard continue to continuous river torrent of the momentum.\nI deliberately coughed a few times.\nWe both seemed to think of something else and both laughed together.\n",

<p>I wiggled up frantically. This caught the attention of the killer, Zhang Jianjun.</p>
<p>He temporarily turned off the intercom and asked me again, &ldquo;Where are you not feeling well? Do you want to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying that, he took out a pocket, took out a plastic bag, which was sealed with a white handkerchief.</p>
<p>Which I do not understand, immediately shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you just wave?&rdquo; He cursed.</p>
<p>I thought to myself that this is called a wave? But I remembered what the master psychologist had said earlier. The killer&rsquo;s mind is twisted, not the same as normal people, with his own set of theories, so this kind of people, or not to contradict him for the better.</p>
<p>I forced down my heart all sorts of uneasiness, as gentle as possible, with him again shaking his head to show.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect a good effect. He walked up to me and tore a piece of tape off my mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; He at least didn&rsquo;t curse anymore, but took the initiative to ask me.</p>
<p>I stared at the intercom and looked at him again. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t shown my face in a long time, and if I keep this up, someone will get suspicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came up with a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the rules and won&rsquo;t talk nonsense, just let me show my face here (on the walkie-talkie)!&rdquo; I gestured.</p>
<p>He finally agreed and put the walkie-talkie in front of my mouth, but at the same time, he also raised the iron hook so that the tip of the hook was pointed at my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mess up, okay?&rdquo; He warned with a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>I nodded my head.</p>
<p>When he turned on the intercom, I remained staring at him, which was actually a little trick; I was steadying him with my eyes and my own expression.
&ldquo;Guys, stop talking nonsense and get down to business. Ahem!&rdquo; At the end, I pointed my voice and coughed.</p>
<p>The killer hastily turned off the intercom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a cold?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>I deliberately put on a hard face and nodded in gesture.</p>
<p>Also have to be thankful that the killer did not find the end. And at this point, what I wanted most was for the beard to understand what I really meant.</p>
<p>Just before, when the murderer talked to everyone on the intercom, I secretly observed the scene outside the window.</p>
<p>Directly outside the window was a crooked-necked tree. This is simply too marked.</p>
<p>There is a dumpling restaurant in Baoshan County that sells dumplings named a tree! The reason is simple, there is a crooked-necked tree growing in the house of this store.</p>
<p>At the time, the store owner had someone look at it and said it was a fortune tree, so not only did not cut, and eventually became its sign.</p>
<p>Beard and I went to this dumpling store to eat many times. Originally the dumplings are really quite delicious, but the beard and I complained, saying that the waiter here is too unqualified, coughing when serving, that is not her saliva, all sprayed on the dumplings?</p>
<p>I reassured him then, out of sight, out of mind!</p>
<p>And that cough I just made was imitating the waitress.</p>
<p>If he was smart, he would have guessed that I was now in trouble and imprisoned near the &ldquo;one tree&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, beard!&rdquo; I kept praying.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the murderer&rsquo;s purpose was in capturing me in the first place, but for now, he wasn&rsquo;t trying to kill me, but to talk to me.</p>
<p>This is also attributed to my &ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have an attitude: don&rsquo;t contradict, go along with him, in order to buy all the time!</p>
<p>I suspect he hadn&rsquo;t spoken to anyone in a long time, so when he opened his mouth, he simply became a talker.</p>
<p>He first did a round of emotions: &ldquo;Why is there so much unfairness in this world? Some people are born with a golden spoon, while others are born with a disability and are abandoned by their families, why is that so?</p>
<p>If someone is just born to be treacherous and lazy and gluttonous, and therefore abandoned, that also makes people have nothing to say, but those demented people, they do not even have a chance to struggle, why is it so unfair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he asked me in all seriousness: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we socialists? Aren&rsquo;t we eating a big pot of rice and there is no difference between the rich and the poor? But why doesn&rsquo;t anyone care about them (the demented)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I were someone else, or if I were free now, I would have told the truth, which is not a bull&rsquo;s-eye or what?</p>
<p>But in order to prevent provoking him, I deliberately nodded seriously and responded, &ldquo;You have a point!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The killer sighed again and sat down next to me in exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what? I wanted to help them so much, even stay with them, ask for food together, and also bring all the good things I have, to them, but it&rsquo;s no use! They&rsquo;ll never be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was right, the murderer&rsquo;s eyes were red. This murderer, to his surprise, was crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are animals!&rdquo; He also choked up.</p>
<p>I saw it with my own eyes, otherwise I would never have believed that the word beast coming out of his mouth was not a derogatory word at all.</p>
<p>I also suddenly particularly helpless, thinking back, when we all saw the handwriting at the scene, who would have thought that the word beast, this meaning?</p>
<p>I adjusted my mood and interjected again tentatively, &ldquo;You played them the tape because you wanted to cure them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The killer smiled bitterly. I took this as a reply.</p>
<p>But the boy turned over his face faster than a book. All of a sudden, his anger was so strong: &ldquo;That fake, thanks to his name Zhang Jianjun! Is he worthy of it! I worshipped this qigong master with the same name as me and had high hopes, but he lied to me! Especially that poor guy (the first deceased), after he heard the tape, he actually disliked me, saying that I was not good to him and let him listen to this kind of disgusting baloney!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you killed this guy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was relief! I didn&rsquo;t want him to suffer so much anymore, like a beast. Since I can&rsquo;t find a cure anymore, instead of that, I&rsquo;ll use my way and give him a relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He even gestured up at this point: &ldquo;Cut off the head, this thing is bad, so don&rsquo;t want it. As for the body, hang them up and let them ascend to heaven. I believe they will be reincarnated in the next life! Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I actually wanted to vomit and felt disgusted by his twisted thinking, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it, I played hard to calm down and nodded &ldquo;hypocritically&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Next he kept cursing the qigong master named Zhang Jianjun.</p>
<p>I also understood that the reason he buried the murder weapon and human head in the yard of the qigong master, is to &ldquo;tell&rdquo; the qigong master one thing: his qigong useless, and the bad thing (head), he also disliked, simply give the qigong master.</p>
<p>I counted in my heart that the master had disappeared for half a month. Although the current look, he is more than lucky, but I still asked: &ldquo;Do you know where that Zhang Jianjun went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The killer patted my shoulder, as if to say, you asked a very good question!</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;I know the police are taking good care of him. But I found an opportunity to take him captive. Originally I told him that people are not afraid to make mistakes, as long as they can repent. So I asked him to come with me to &lsquo;help&rsquo; demented people, but I never thought he would dare to resist such a good advice from me. Especially after originally agreeing to it for three days, he suddenly backtracked. Thanks to me for treating him as a friend and giving him the good stuff! This liar who is not what he seems, so I later decided, again, to tie a stone to his feet and throw him in the pond to feed the fish. This kind of person, not worthy of ascension, or feed the fish, at least the fish have grown fat, we eat when there is a mouthful of well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he looked at me again, took out a face confused expression: &ldquo;I finally left a note, specifically told you ah, that Zhang Jianjun is in the pond. But I look at the news and newspapers in the past few days, why there is Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s search notice? So that night, I went back to look at it, I did not expect &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He covered his mouth and laughed: &ldquo;You guys even used the pump to pump the pond. Really stupid, at that time I deliberately left a blood trail, so that it extends to the pond. In fact, you guys just need to cast a net there and fish a few times, you will be able to find Zhang Jianjun&rsquo;s body, well &hellip;&hellip; maybe it has turned into a skeleton. Also the heads of the three ascendants, all bad stuff anyway! All were left there by me. Actually fished up really effortlessly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened frozen. Also recalled the picture at the scene of the crime, the note that said: come find me, Zhang Jianjun!</p>
<p>But who would have thought that the meaning of this note is so.</p>
<p>The next half an hour, I continued to chat along with the killer. And he, in fact, more and more favorable to me, and even come up with a look of regret, saying that it would be good to know me early, because he and I are in many ways heroes where slightly the same.</p>
<p>I smiled on the surface, but in my heart there is a feeling of crying, there is a moment, I dislike myself a little, said with this kind of person like-minded.</p>
<p>And this kind of acting against your will, very painful. If the beard did not appear, I do not know how long I can hold on &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the house door was kicked open.</p>
<p>In fact, the killer reacted quickly, the moment the door was broken, he bounced up like a panther.</p>
<p>As for me, I also seized this one opportunity. Although they are tied, but do not forget that the mouth is not sealed.</p>
<p>What time is it, what are the rules? I leaned forward with all my might and bit his wrist holding the iron hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bastard!&rdquo; He cursed in pain, and kicked me hard.</p>
<p>Like a potato, I rolled to the side. But such a delay bought time for the beard who took the brunt of the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, dare to hit the old leather!&rdquo; He cursed and lunged forward.</p>
<p>I was worried that he would not lose, after all, the killer had a weapon. But this worry seems superfluous.</p>
<p>Who was Beard? Once the prison&rsquo;s big oil!</p>
<p>Not a few moves it, the beard will ride the murderer in the crotch, that is, I shouted in time, otherwise the beard&rsquo;s fist, certainly hit the murderer&rsquo;s right temple.</p>
<p>It is clear that the beard for me, this time to death!</p>
<p>But in the end, the murderer&rsquo;s neck swelled up a cut, he also completely fainted.</p>
<p>The bearded man&rsquo;s body lurched and slid off the murderer.</p>
<p>He looked at me, and I looked at him.</p>
<p>He deliberately coughed and he laughed.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>August 15, 1993.</p>
<p>It lasted a whole month and a half before the case was finally solved.</p>
<p>But the beard and I did not have the opportunity to participate in its follow-up, when Yunnan staged a major event, the local police force is insufficient, the police asked for help from the provinces.</p>
<p>The two of us were arranged by Ma Sanshui, rushed to Yunnan overnight.</p>
<p>I guess many people have heard of that case later, known as the &ldquo;black man hotel series of murders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That case, not here to describe one by one, but the case of Zhang Jianjun, I later listened to other eyes and ears and introduced some of the situation.
It is said that Zhang Jianjun, this person, since childhood, has a &ldquo;temper&rdquo;, playing games with his friends, everyone must listen to him, regardless of what he said right or wrong, or he will not be happy, and even fight with those who do not obey.</p>
<p>After elementary school, there was an art class, the teacher asked everyone to draw a horse, Zhang Jianjun actually drew a thing that was not a cow or a horse, the teacher said he was wrong, he retorted in class, saying that this was the horse in his heart. Finally, when everyone in the class laughed at him, he was so angry that he tore up the painting that he had drawn for one class.</p>
<p>At the age of 18, Zhang Jianjun was in the army. In fact, he is a soldier material, all aspects are outstanding, even the instructor evaluation, he is suitable for special forces.</p>
<p>The problem is, he also has a shortcoming, not only do not obey orders, but also always looking for instructors to ask some strange and bizarre questions. For example, what he couldn&rsquo;t understand was: why are there so many people becoming soldiers? Now there is no war, the soldiers only drill every day, what a waste of manpower? Why don&rsquo;t we cut back and send most of the soldiers home and let them serve the community?</p>
<p>In fact, his eccentric thinking since childhood, but also destined to his path is increasingly narrow. Especially after he changed jobs from the military, he was further isolated.</p>
<p>He has changed many jobs, basically for his own personal reasons. Because of this, he always felt that he was being unfairly treated, and even this view was, step by step, amplified to demented people.</p>
<p>He became more and more sympathetic to the demented person, and with his distorted thinking, he also wanted to make the demented person live a normal life again with his own efforts. For example, take the demented person to seek medical treatment. But this brain disease, how can be cured?</p>
<p>Finally, he put his hope on the qigong masters, especially in Baoshan County, there is a qigong master with the same name as him, this person is very famous, and even some tabloid news that this person has also cured cancer.</p>
<p>Zhang Jianjun for this reason, writing letters, trying to visit, etc., but the master, a face of superiority and arrogance, simply do not see him.
Finally Zhang Jianjun could only buy tapes, after all, the qigong master said, the tape with his gong power, can also cure the disease.</p>
<p>And the next early one morning, looking at the demented person did not get better at all, Zhang Jianjun completely disappointed, under the influence of distorted thinking, he also used his own method, the demented person freed, went to heaven &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>About this person, Zhang Jianjun, after my beard and I went to Yunnan, we also had several private discussions.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to discussing him, we also play on the topic, and finally talk about &ldquo;fairness&rdquo;. After all, Zhang Jianjun before being shot, are shouting, saying that this society is unfair to him!</p>
<p>Hu Zi does not like to hide, expressed his views: &ldquo;What do you mean by fairness? What do you mean by unfair? In fact, there is no absolute fairness? Like us, we made a big mistake back then, and now in order to cleanse the soul of the last dirty soil, so become the eyes and ears, almost every day to face, to do with criminals and life and death struggle. In fact, is it easy for us? Is it fair to us? When the mistake was made before, if there is a person to pull us a hand, let us hang on the horse, it will not follow so nagging? But &hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beard thought of what, suddenly happy ha ha laughed: &ldquo;I still say, this society is good, and will get better and better, but anyone who is born in this world, but also have to be prepared for a psychological. No matter where in this world, there is no absolute fairness, so do not give up the right to live because of &lsquo;unfairness&rsquo;, and we should not give up the pursuit of happiness because of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look at the beard continue to continuous river torrent of the momentum.</p>
<p>I deliberately coughed a few times.</p>
<p>We both seemed to think of something else and both laughed together.</p>
